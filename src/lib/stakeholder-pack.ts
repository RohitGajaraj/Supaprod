/**
 * STAKEHOLDER-PACK (v11 #19) — PURE composer for audience-tuned persuasion artifacts.
 *
 * v11 pains research, GAP #1: Cadence already PRODUCES the evidence (a decision + its
 * receipts: what changed, why, the proof, who approved it, whether it still stands), but a
 * PM still has to hand-build the deck that wins each room. This module turns one decision +
 * its receipts into the artifact each audience actually needs — the same facts, re-framed:
 *   - exec:  bottom-line first (the call, what it stands on, the ask), minimal mechanism.
 *   - eng:   the rationale, constraints, and provenance — the "why" engineers will challenge.
 *   - board: the strategic framing + governance + standing — trust, not implementation.
 *
 * It reuses the Trust Ledger's receipt fields (no new data) and the humanized-output voice.
 * PURE: no db, no network, no AI; the composition + rendering are unit-verifiable. The server
 * adapter passes a normalized brief in. NO migration, NO chokepoint.
