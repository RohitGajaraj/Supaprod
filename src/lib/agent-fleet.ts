// AGENT-FLEET-VIEW (v11 #30) — the pure by-AGENT fleet model (air-traffic-control).
//
// DELEGATE-DESK (#25) frames the work BY MISSION — the lifecycle of each task you
// handed off. This is the orthogonal lens: BY AGENT — the fleet itself. It pivots
// the same agent_runs rows on agent_slug so a PM orchestrating a fleet can see, at
// a glance, who is working, how loaded each agent is, who is idle, and — the
// founder's "supervise by exception" — who is hitting failures. Same data, a
// different question: not "where is my work" but "how is my fleet".
//
// PURE: no db / network / React / time-of-day. The adapter passes run rows (and
// optionally the roster, so idle agents still show); the route renders. The
// invariants (per-agent tallies, the attention-first ordering, the summary) are
// unit-verified.
