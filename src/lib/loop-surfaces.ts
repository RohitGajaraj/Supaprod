// STITCH-LOOP (v11 #9) — the surface-level loop model. The engine is already one
// continuous loop (Sense -> Decide -> Define -> Build -> Ship -> Learn, plus the
// receipts); the SURFACES the operator walks between read as separate screens.
// This pure model names the seven surfaces in loop order, what each hands forward,
// and where the operator currently sits, so a single calm strip (LoopThread) can
// make the one-system continuity felt on every surface.
//
// Pure + dependency-free on purpose: all the matching/neighbour logic is unit-
// tested under bun without a DOM, and the renderer (LoopThread.tsx) stays a thin
// view that cannot drift from this source of truth.

// The loop, in order. It is a CYCLE: Trust's proof feeds back into Today, where
// the next decision re-enters discovery in Product. Neighbours wrap accordingly.
//
// Declared `as const` and used as the source of truth for the types below, so each
// `to` keeps its literal route type — that lets TanStack Router's `<Link to>`
// validate these against the real route tree (a future route rename then fails
// `tsc`, instead of silently dead-linking). Fields: `label` = the name shown in the
// rail; `to` = the route this stage links to (`/prds` resolves to the specs view of
// Product); `produces` = what this stage hands forward (the felt-continuity payload).
