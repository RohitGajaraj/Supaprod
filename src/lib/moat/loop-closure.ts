/**
 * LOOP-PROVE (v11 #5) — PURE closure proof for the decision→outcome→supersession loop.
 *
 * The moat's promise is a LOOP that closes: a decision is made → an outcome is recorded
 * against it → that outcome supersedes (or contradicts) the prior belief → the next time a
 * similar precedent is cited, the graph resolves it forward to the CURRENT governing
 * decision instead of the stale match. DBR (H1) / LRN-02 / W1-AUTO / MOAT-METRIC all
 * implement pieces of this, but nothing ever ASSERTED the chain produces real edges end to
 * end — so a silently cold moat (0 edges) looks identical to a working one until you stare
 * at the data.
 *
 * This module is that assertion. It composes the EXISTING engine (`resolveGoverning`'s
 * supersession walk) over raw graph rows and reports, stage by stage, whether the loop is
 * closed and — when it is not — which exact stage is cold. It is the diagnostic behind
 * "prove the loop closes on real data": run it against live data and `closed === true` is
 * the proof; against an empty graph it names the missing stage instead of failing silent.
 *
 * PURE: no db, no network, no AI; unit-verifiable in isolation. It REUSES the decision-brain
 * core rather than re-deriving the walk, so the proof can never drift from the engine it
 * proves. NO migration, NO chokepoint.
