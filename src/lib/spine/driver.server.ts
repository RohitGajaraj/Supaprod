/**
 * The autonomous driver: one tick of one track through the loop.
 *
 * FOUNDER RULING 2026-08-01: "seamlessly agent takes care of everything and
 * human just watches. And even if human do not watch, agent should be able to
 * complete entire thing and deliver the outcome to the user."
 *
 * WHAT THIS CLOSES. Every station already worked, and the orchestrator already
 * drove missions autonomously inside Build. What nothing did was carry ONE
 * piece of work from Discover through Learn: `loop-state.functions.ts` reports
 * which stage work is in but never moves it, and a station transition was a
 * `navigate()` call in a component. A navigate call requires a person to click,
 * so the loop stopped the instant nobody was watching. That is the gap.
 *
 * IT DOES NO PRODUCT WORK ITSELF. It decides who acts and whether the track may
 * move; the station's own agent does the work with its own tools under its own
 * boundary. The decision rules are pure and unit-tested in ./driver.ts, which
 * is where the stop conditions live, because a driver that runs when it should
 * not is worse than no driver.
 *
 * THE BOUNDARY IS NOT BYPASSED, and this is the part that makes autonomy
 * defensible rather than reckless. The driver dispatches through `runAgentLoop`,
 * the same pinned chokepoint every other dispatch uses, so `resolveToolMode`,
 * the high-risk floors, the trust arc and the spend cap all still bind exactly
 * as they do for a human-started run. When the agent reaches something its
 * boundary does not let it do alone, the loop queues the call and the driver
 * STOPS, leaving the track where it is. Autonomy here means nobody has to press
 * go, never that policy stopped applying.
