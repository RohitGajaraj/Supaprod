/**
 * BLD-04 (Delegate-out to external coding agents): the `DelegateProvider` seam.
 *
 * One swappable abstraction for "hand a build task off to an external coding
 * agent, still governed". The first wired target is OpenHands self-host (Apache,
 * free); Devin / Claude-Code / SWE-agent are reserved ids that plug in behind the
 * same interface once the founder confirms the BYO endpoint + key. The whole
 * capability is DORMANT by default: with no `DELEGATE_OUTBOUND_ENABLED` flag and
 * no endpoint configured, the resolver returns the {@link nullDelegateProvider}
 * floor, which accepts nothing, so a misconfiguration can never silently fan a
 * build out to an unconfigured external agent.
 *
 * This module is PURE (no env, no I/O): the contract, the null floor, and the
 * request/response mapping. The env-reading + network adapter lives in the
 * server-only seam `openhands.server.ts`, so this file is safe to import anywhere.
 *
 * Mirrors the proven SANDBOX `ExecProvider` seam (`@/lib/exec/provider`): scaffold
 * the seam + ship the dormant floor; do NOT provision an account, add a secret, or
 * turn on outbound delegation (those are founder-only). Wiring the tool into the
 * live agent loop (the registry + the loop's review-force) is a separate increment
 * (it touches the pinned chokepoint files); see `docs/features/bld04-delegate-out.md`.
