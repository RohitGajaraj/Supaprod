/**
 * Sub-processor disclosure registry (Data/Privacy, considerations.md).
 *
 * Enterprise security reviews and GDPR Article 28 require a current list of the third parties
 * that process customer data on Supaprod's behalf. This module is that list, derived where
 * possible from live configuration so the disclosure cannot drift from reality:
 *
 *   - Infrastructure sub-processors (the gateway, the database, the host) are a curated static
 *     list, since they are not encoded elsewhere in the app.
 *   - AI model providers are derived from the model catalog (`MODELS`): a provider is an ACTIVE
 *     sub-processor only when at least one of its models is `live` (data actually flows to it
 *     today). Adapter-ready providers (`live: false`, BYO-key only) are listed as INACTIVE so a
 *     customer who enables BYO can see who would then receive their prompts; `ollama` is excluded
 *     because it is self-hosted by the customer, so it is never a third-party sub-processor.
 *
 * Pure (no IO), so it is fully unit-tested in subprocessors.test.ts and safe to import on the
 * client (it carries no secrets). The legal-reviewed public copy, exact processing regions, and
 * the DPA links are a founder/legal pass on top of this factual base (see the feature doc).
