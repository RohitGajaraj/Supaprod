// M-A: turn the user-wide autonomy ratio (the Gauntlet's Metric C) into a
// visible position on the observing -> proving -> trusted ladder for the Today
// card. Pure + client-safe (no server middleware), so it is unit-testable in
// isolation, mirroring gauntlet-metrics.ts.
//
// OBSERVATIONAL ONLY. The stage is a reflection of how much reversible work the
// loop already runs unattended; it is NOT a safety gate (the real gate is the
// per-agent arc in agent_autonomy, applied by resolveApprovalMode) and it is NOT
// a stored per-user tier (none exists in the domain). The per-agent arc DOES
// auto-advance on clean runs (auto_advance_agent_arc); this card just mirrors the
// user-wide ratio, a separate figure recomputed each render, never stored and
// never "advanced". So the copy describes the stage; it never instructs the
// operator to "promote" agents and never points at a per-user advance control
// (there is none). The claim never outruns the wiring.
