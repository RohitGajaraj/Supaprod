 * Entitlements: the pure plan-to-capability map (the Constellation tier ladder).
 *
 * No DB and no side effects, so it is unit-tested directly. The plan tier is a
 * canonical SLUG (free | pro | max | team | enterprise) that lives on the
 * account (workspaces.plan_tier is a transition-era compat shim, set only by
 * billing). This module turns a slug into the limits + capability booleans the
 * app gates on, and into the display presentation. Enforcement of each gate is
 * wired separately and incrementally (WM-M2..WM-M16); this module is the single
 * source of truth for what each tier is entitled to.
 *
 * Naming is presentation-only: the database, Stripe, and RLS key on the slugs;
 * display names (Free / Pro / Business / Enterprise) live only in
 * planPresentation(), so any tier can be renamed later with a one-file edit and
 * no migration. Build against slugs, never display names.
 *
 * Credit and price NUMBERS here are deliberate placeholders, founder-tunable
 * (plan §7); the mechanism is final. The credit engine stays dormant behind
 * credits_enabled() until the founder flips it (WM-M10..WM-M16).
