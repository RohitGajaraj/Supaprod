/**
 * WM-S1: Explore workspace seeder.
 *
 * Seeds a freshly created workspace with lightweight starter content so every
 * new signup lands in a populated space. Gated by ONBOARDING_SEED_ENABLED=1.
 * This is NOT the rich demo seed (that is WM-S5, last).
 *
 * RLS note: inserts use the admin client but set workspace_id and user_id to
 * the actual new user and workspace. The seeded rows are therefore correctly
 * owned and are visible through all normal RLS policies.
 *
 * Never throws to the caller. Insert errors are logged and swallowed so a
 * seeding failure never blocks the workspace creation success path.
