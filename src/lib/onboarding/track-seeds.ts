/* WHY EVERY SEEDED PROJECT SAYS "EXAMPLE" IN ITS NAME.
 *
 * These fixtures are written into the user's OWN workspace by
 * `seedWorkspaceForTrack`, fired unconditionally when they submit step 1 of
 * onboarding. Nothing marked them: a brand-new account arrived holding four
 * signals and four opportunities it never wrote, indistinguishable from its own
 * data. "90% of sign-ups drop after day 1" is a specific, alarming, and
 * completely invented number about somebody's real product.
 *
 * The repo's own rule (docs/features/production-ship-readiness.md) is "real
 * data, or clearly-labelled sample data by explicit choice, never fabricated
 * data presented as real", and this failed it on both counts.
 *
 * The sibling seeding path already does this properly: seed-workspace.server.ts
 * creates a SEPARATE workspace and stamps `workspaces.is_sample = true`. This
 * path writes into the real one, and signals, opportunities and projects carry
 * no sample column to stamp. So the label goes where it is guaranteed to be
 * seen and cannot be missed: the name of the project every seeded record hangs
 * off, and the description under it.
 *
 * The seed is KEPT rather than deleted. A workspace with something in it is a
 * far better first run than an empty one, and the empty states are only good
 * because they are honest. This makes the full one honest too.
