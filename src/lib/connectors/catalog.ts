// CONNECTORS-V11 (v11 #14) — the pure connector CATALOG model.
//
// Connectors are scattered across three surfaces (Settings → Accounts, Settings →
// Integrations, and /sources) and re-rendered in three different shapes, with no
// grouping — so the same providers read as a repetitive, confusing list. This
// module derives ONE canonical, de-duped, CATEGORIZED catalog from the connector
// registry: the single source of truth for "what can I connect, what does it do,
// which way does data move, and how do I connect it". Any surface that renders
// connectors consumes this, so the lists stop being repetitive and inconsistent,
// and every available source is visible from day one (the OAuth wiring itself —
// F-CONN / SEN-01 — stays founder-gated; this is the presentation layer).
//
// PURE: derives from CONNECTOR_REGISTRY only; no db / network / React. The
// invariants (every user-facing provider categorized exactly once, the flow +
// connect derivations) are unit-verified.
