// AMBIENT-TRIGGER (v11 #4) - the pure self-initiation policy: given accumulated workspace
// state (signal clusters that grew, recorded outcomes), decide which missions to
// self-originate, with NO database, NO AI call, NO I/O. Deterministic + unit-testable. The
// `trigger-tick` cron is the thin server glue that loads state, calls this, and writes the
// proposed missions + their Trust-Ledger receipts.
//
// This is the complement to the event reactor (reactor.functions.ts), which reacts to
// DISCRETE events (signal.created, opportunity.scored). AMBIENT-TRIGGER reacts to ACCUMULATED
// STATE crossing a threshold - the "self-driving" behavior: no human start.
//
// Reversibility governance (v11): a proposal is only ever a PROPOSED mission (a status the
// resume-runs executor ignores), so the policy commits ZERO AI spend and nothing irreversible
// happens until a human/founder promotes it to running. `reversible` is carried so a future
// activation policy can auto-run reversible internal missions while always HITL-gating the rest.
//
// Idempotency: each proposal's TITLE is its stable identity (it embeds the cluster name or the
// outcome summary, so it is unique per trigger source). The tick passes the titles of already
// open `[auto]` missions; a proposal whose title is already open is dropped. The title is the
// only anchor recoverable from `missions` (no metadata column), so dedup keys on it.
