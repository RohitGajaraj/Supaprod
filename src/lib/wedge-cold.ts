// CORE-UX-FELT (#11) — first-run failure hardening for the Critic-teardown wedge.
//
// The wedge is the cold-start FIRST IMPRESSION: a brand-new operator names an idea
// and gets a teardown with no setup. The happy path and the gateway-cold path (the
// Critic returns a null verdict, handled gracefully) are already solid. The remaining
// gap is a HARD failure — the AI gateway throwing instead of degrading, a network
// blip, or a DB error: today that surfaces a raw technical toast on the single most
// important first screen. This pure classifier turns the raw error into a calm,
// honest, actionable message so a first-run user never meets a stack-trace-shaped
// string.
//
// Pure + dependency-free: classification is unit-tested over plain messages.
