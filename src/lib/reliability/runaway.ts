/**
 * RUNAWAY-DETECT: pure detector for missions that are SPINNING.
 *
 * Closes the `considerations.md` AI-safety-lens P1 gap "Loop/runaway detection" ("agents can spin;
 * cap + detect"). KI-15/16 added the CAPS (per-tick mission fairness + per-mission step-dispatch
 * bounds); this is the DETECT half: surface a mission whose hop/step/retry/spend has blown past
 * normal so an operator (or a future alert) sees it. It is the inverse of E8's stall monitor
 * (loop-health.functions.ts): stall = too LITTLE progress, runaway = too MUCH churn. Together they
 * bracket "the loop is misbehaving."
 *
 * Pure and deterministic (the clock is injected as `ageMinutes`), so the whole verdict is unit-tested
 * with no DB and no publish. The thin `getRunawayMissions` server fn (reliability.functions.ts) only
 * aggregates missions/mission_steps/agent_runs into {@link MissionRunStats} and runs `assessMission`.
 *
 * Calibration: these defaults are independently-chosen heuristics that sit deliberately ABOVE the
 * loop's own enforcement, so a flag means "well past normal," not "near a cap." Specifics: there is
 * no hard hop ceiling (hop_count climbs unbounded via a DB trigger), and the per-mission step
 * dispatch cap is small and per-tick (DISPATCH_CAP, default ~10), so maxSteps 50 / maxHops 20 only
 * trip on real spinning. The per-step signal stays above the default retry ceiling (max_attempts
 * defaults to 2, i.e. at most 2 dispatches per step), so a normally-exhausted retry never trips.

 * escalated as actionable-now forever, inside the mechanism whose only job is to

 *
 * `completed_with_failures` is contested elsewhere in the repo (K-60 leaves it

 * bucket it belongs in for a fleet count, it is unambiguously FINISHED, so it
 * cannot be actionable now. That is why it is safe here and not safe there.
 *
 * The singular `complete` is deliberately absent. Its only writer
 * (agents.functions.ts:211) updates agent_runs, not missions, and every
