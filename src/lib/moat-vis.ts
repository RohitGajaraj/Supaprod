/**
 * MOAT-VIS — make the compounding visible (PURE core).
 *
 * The outcome loop already moves an opportunity's ICE when a human records a
 * shipped PRD's real-world outcome (recordOutcome -> a `learnings` row carrying
 * prior_ice/new_ice + the verdict that caused it). This module turns that audit
 * trail into the visible "memory is correcting your priorities from real
 * outcomes" story for the Today + Brain surfaces.
 *
 * Pure (no db/network/AI), so it is fully unit-testable. The server fn
 * (getCompounding in today.functions.ts) supplies the learning rows.
 *
 * Honest framing: a rescore can move ICE DOWN (a missed outcome lowers
 * confidence). That is the loop working, not a regression, so the summary is
 * neutral (count + up/down + net), never a one-directional "always up" claim.
