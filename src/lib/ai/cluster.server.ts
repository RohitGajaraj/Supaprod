 * responseFormat=json_object and the exact same system/user prompt, sometimes drops the
 * documented `{"themes": [...]}` wrapper and returns the bare array of theme objects
 * directly instead, most reproducibly seen on small signal batches (2 unclustered
 * signals reproduced it twice in a row live). The raw text is valid, parseable JSON either
 * way (parseModelJson/JSON.parse succeed on both shapes); this was never a JSON-parsing
 * problem. The actual bug was downstream: casting the parsed value to `{ themes?: [...] }`
 * and reading `.themes` off a top-level array is always `undefined`, so a perfectly valid,
 * on-schema response was discarded and thrown away as "invalid JSON". Accept either shape.

/**
 * Core signal-clustering logic, shared by the user-triggered `clusterSignals`

 * (service-role, RLS bypassed). Reads unclustered signals for ONE user, asks
 * the model for themes, and persists them with lineage.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this explicitly filters `signals.user_id = userId`. The cron path
 * runs under the service role (RLS off), so without this filter it would
 * cluster every user's signals together. The user-session path is already
 * RLS-scoped to the same user, so the filter is harmless there.
 *
 * `workspaceId` is passed through to `callModel` so the workspace kill-switch
 * and spend caps apply (the cron clusters on behalf of a workspace owner).
 * `projectId` scopes clustering to one product when set (F3 per-product).
