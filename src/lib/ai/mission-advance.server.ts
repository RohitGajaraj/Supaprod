/**
 * Deterministic mission advance (v6 Phase 1 — "the loop runs itself").
 *
 * Once the orchestrator has planned a mission's DAG (mission.plan) and dispatched
 * its first wave, the rest of the mission no longer needs the orchestrator model:
 * advancing is mechanical. This module is that engine —
 *   reflect child-run outcomes onto steps (+ bounded retry)
 *     → claim & dispatch every newly-ready step (threading memory into the hop)
 *       → finalize when the whole DAG is terminal.
 * It is:
 *   - model-free (no callModel) → cheap, deterministic, and safe to run every tick,
 *   - admin-client compatible → called by the resume-runs sweeper (admin client)
 *     AND by the advanceMission server fn (user client),
 *   - concurrency-safe on dispatch → claim-first CAS, so overlapping sweeper
 *     ticks can never double-enqueue the same step.
 *
 * The orchestrator model still owns the INITIAL plan + wave-0 dispatch; from
 * there this carries the mission to completion unattended (Appendix B: this is
 * the "mid-loop hops need the orchestrator re-invoked" gap, closed).
 *
 * Pre-migration tolerant: the retry columns (attempts/max_attempts/next_retry_at)
 * land on the next Lovable sync. Until then `hasRetryColumns` probes false and the
 * engine degrades to the prior behavior (no retry — a failed hop terminalizes),
 * while auto-advance + memory threading still work. No deploy-order dependency.
