// to AND recalls from. This is distinct from the Knowledge > Memory tab, which
// renders the `learnings` table (the human-recorded outcome audit). This surface
// shows what the LOOP stored for itself - reflections agents wrote, outcomes it
// distilled - ranked by what it recalled most recently (last_used_at). A memory
// the loop keeps reaching for is the compounding proof; nothing here claims more
// than the data shows.

// agent_memory is owner-scoped (RLS auth.uid() = user_id) with no workspace_id
// column, so the RLS-bound client already scopes every read to the caller - the
// view is the account's whole institutional memory, the same shape as the
// Gauntlet metrics. The explicit user_id filter is defense-in-depth and lets
// Postgres use the (user_id, agent_slug) index.
