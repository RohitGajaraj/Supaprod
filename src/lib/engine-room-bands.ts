// IA-DEPTH-V11 (v11 #23, slice) — the pure band model for the Engine Room nav.
//
// The Engine Room (/govern) presents 13 flat peer tabs (Controls · Attention ·
// Team · Approvals · Safety · Spend · Prompts · Quality checks · Analytics · Loop
// health · Activity · Trends · Incidents) — too dense to scan. This module groups
// them into 3 calm bands (Needs you / Trust & safety / Quality & insight) WITHOUT
// changing the ?tab= routing contract: every tab id is preserved and still lands
// on the exact same panel; the banding is purely how the nav is presented. The
// route renders a band selector (tier 1) + the active band's tabs (tier 2).
//
// PURE: data + derivations only, no JSX. The invariants (every tab in exactly one
// band, the default tab lands in the first band, round-trip derivation) are
// unit-verified. Labels + per-tab descriptions stay in the route (the existing
// reference copy); this module owns only the grouping.
