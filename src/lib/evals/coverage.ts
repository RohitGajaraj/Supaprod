/**
 * EVAL-COVERAGE — pure scorer for "which AI surfaces have an eval guard, and which do not".
 *
 * Closes the `considerations.md` AI-safety-lens P1 gap "Eval coverage targets per surface/agent"
 * ("Today coverage is partial; autonomy needs broad coverage"). The eval substrate already supports
 * suite CRUD, score trends, and scheduled runs, but nothing answered the governance question: which
 * of the canonical AI surfaces have NO eval guard at all. This computes that, completing the
 * "is the autonomy actually guarded" triad with RELIABILITY-SLO (is it reliable) and RUNAWAY-DETECT
 * (is it spinning).
 *
 * Coverage vs pass-rate: a suite's score TREND answers "is the eval passing"; coverage answers the
 * more fundamental "is the surface guarded at all". So a `completed` last run = covered (the guard
 * ran), independent of whether its cases passed. An enabled-but-EMPTY suite (0 runnable cases) is a
 * hollow guard, so it counts as `stale`, never `covered`.
 *
 * Pure and total: the scorer takes normalized suite rows + the canonical targets and returns a
 * report, no I/O, fully unit-tested. The thin `getEvalCoverage` server fn (evals.functions.ts) maps
 * `eval_suites` + the newest `eval_runs` status per suite into {@link SuiteCoverageInput}.
