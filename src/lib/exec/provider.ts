/**
 * SANDBOX (Build / execution spine) — the `ExecProvider` seam.
 *
 * One swappable abstraction for "where a build's checks run, and whether the
 * result clears it to merge / preview". Today there is no Supaprod execution
 * sandbox (see `ai/studio-ci.ts`): checks run in the connected repo's GitHub
 * Actions CI, which is the $0 native floor and is ALWAYS available. A paid
 * microVM backend — Cloudflare Sandbox SDK first, with E2B / Vercel one swap
 * away for untrusted code — plugs in behind this same interface once the founder
 * confirms the compute spend (sourcing-map founder call #4). Until then the
 * floor holds and the paid backends are reserved ids that resolve back to the
 * floor, so a misconfiguration can never strand a build with no way to run.
 *
 * The floor reuses `studio-ci.ts`, so an `ExecProvider` verdict and the
 * `studio.pr.merge` gate can never disagree on what "green" means.
 *
 * Doctrine: this is the un-gated prep the sourcing-map authorizes — scaffold the
 * seam + ship the $0 floor; do NOT provision a paid account, add a secret, or
 * turn on metered compute (those are founder-only).
