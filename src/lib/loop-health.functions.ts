/**
 * Loop Health Monitor (E8) — catch a stalled loop before it bites.
 *
 * A read of the autonomous loop's vital signs: whether anything is stuck
 * (in-flight runs that should have advanced, calls that expired waiting), the
 * human queue depth, and how fresh the loop is (last signal in, last run out).
 * Read-only, RLS-scoped (every table is keyed on user_id); each probe degrades
 * to a safe default on error so the monitor can never break the surface it sits
 * on. Powers the LoopHealthBanner on the Missions surface.
