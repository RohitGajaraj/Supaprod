          This page is maintained by the Cadence team to answer common security and privacy
          questions about the product. It describes controls that are enabled today. It is not a
          certification and is not independently verified. Security is a shared responsibility
          between Cadence, our hosting platform, and you as a customer.
        </p>

        <Section title="Access and authentication">
          Sign-in is handled through our managed authentication provider. Sessions are bound to your
          account, and every request to backend data is authorized server-side. Workspace membership
          controls who can read or change data within a workspace, and roles (owner, admin, member,
          viewer) gate sensitive actions such as inviting members or transferring ownership.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Data isolation">
          Customer data is stored in a managed Postgres database with row-level security enabled on
          user-facing tables. Policies scope reads and writes to the signed-in user, their account,
          and their workspace. Billing identifiers and invitation tokens are restricted to
          server-side roles and are never exposed to other members.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Secrets and encryption">
          Connection credentials and API keys you bring into Cadence are encrypted before being
          stored. Decryption happens only inside server-side code paths. Data in transit uses TLS
          provided by the hosting platform.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Subprocessors and integrations">
          Cadence relies on infrastructure and AI providers to deliver the product, and on
          third-party services that you explicitly connect (for example a code repository or
          calendar). Connections you create are scoped to your workspace, and you can disconnect
          them at any time from Settings.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Retention and deletion">
          You can delete data you have created (workspaces, products, documents, signals) from
          inside the app. Account deletion or data export requests can be made through the security
          contact below.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Reporting a security issue">
          If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please email{" "}
          <a href="mailto:security@redcadence.app" style={{ color: "inherit" }}>
            security@redcadence.app
          </a>
          . Please do not publicly disclose the issue until we have had a reasonable chance to
          investigate and remediate.
