/**
 * Today. The front door, ported onto the rebuild primitives (step 4).
 *
 * THE DECISION THIS SURFACE OBEYS: "a brief, not an inbox and not a
 * dashboard" (session-handoff.md "What is decided"). The retired version was
 * 1543 lines and roughly twenty panels: a hero card, lanes, a triage queue, a
 * desk rail, receipts, a masthead, an onramp. That is a dashboard, and a
 * dashboard asks you to scan rather than to decide.
 *
 * So this reads top to bottom and says four things in order:
 *   what happened  ·  what needs you  ·  what was done  ·  what it learned
 *
 * VOICE: never greet, always report. The first line is a fact. The retired
 * version opened with "Good afternoon, {name}", which is exactly what the
 * convention bans.

   * The seven stations, on the surface everyone lands on.
   *
   * FOUNDER RULING 2026-08-01. Today had no link to any of the seven: the rail
   * carries Today, Runs, Brain, Crew and Engine room, and the spine strip was
   * published only by loop surfaces. So the product's entire spine had exactly
   * one door from its own home page, the command palette, which is a keyboard
   * shortcut nobody has been told about yet. That is the door-missing defect on
   * the most visited screen in the app.
   *
   * `null` means no station is lit, which the strip already supports on purpose:
   * "a board opens with no stage selected, and that is a strip with nothing lit,
   * not the absence of a strip". Today is not a station, so nothing should be
   * lit; it is where you see the whole loop before choosing a part of it.
   *
   * This does revise the earlier reading that off a run there is no strip. That
   * reading came from a ruling whose actual words were "that horizontal pane,
   * always remain... right from 01 to 07. It should not collapse", which argues
   * for the strip being present, not absent. The 97px it costs buys the only
   * visible route into the loop from the front door.
