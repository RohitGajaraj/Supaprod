// v6 Phase 0 / W4 — the cold-start on-ramp. A brand-new workspace lands on an
// empty Today; instead of a barren dashboard, the empty state IS the on-ramp.
// It narrates how to feed the loop and points only at WIRED mechanisms — the
// webhook ingest door (/sync), manual signal capture (/discover),
// and source connections (/settings). Rendered only when the workspace is
// genuinely cold (getColdStart → no signals/opportunities/specs), so the seeded
// demo never sees it. Voice: the loop runs the reversible work; you make the
// calls — no overclaiming.
