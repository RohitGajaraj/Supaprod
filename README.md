> **PRODUCT NAME: CADENCE.** The product is **Cadence**, and that is the only name to use. A brief 2026-06-10 rename experiment to a different brand was reverted on 2026-06-16; the retired name must not be reintroduced anywhere (code, docs, DB, env, caches, APIs). Any stray legacy token from that experiment is to be read as equivalent to `cadence`/`Cadence`.

## What this is, in one paragraph

Cadence is the **decision and outcome operating system for product teams.** Most "AI for product" tools are an AI feature bolted onto an app (it drafts, suggests, and waits) or a chatbot (it hands you a paragraph and the work is still yours). Cadence is the other thing: an **AI operating system that owns the loop**, and an **action system where the work is actually done.** You give it intent ("turn this customer signal into the right shipped outcome"), and a swarm of governed agents carries it end to end across the whole product lifecycle: it senses signal, ranks and red-teams the opportunity (the Critic), defines the cited spec, **builds it** (Cadence's own engine, or dispatched to Cursor / Lovable / Devin under the same governance), drafts GTM, triages support, evaluates the outcome, and feeds the result back into the next decision, pausing only for the few calls that genuinely need a human. Every action is cited, observable in a live trace, and reversible. **Agents execute; you decide and stay accountable.** And here is why it is defensible: building software is no longer the bottleneck, **deciding what to build is.** Code has a fast oracle (it compiles in seconds), so building commoditizes; "what to build, and was it right" has no fast oracle (feedback lands in weeks to quarters), so it does not. Cadence owns that **decision-and-outcome layer over three pillars (own the loop, sense continuously, keep the receipts)**, and the auditable, compounding record of what your team decided and whether it was right is the one thing no frontier model or single-suite incumbent can backfill or neutrally own.

## The problem

A product operator today doesn't just do discovery and specs. They own the whole arc: talk to users, decide what's worth building, write the spec, get it built, tested, and shipped, launch it, position and price it, drive distribution, handle support, and learn from the result. That arc is smeared across 15 tools (Intercom, Gong, Notion, Linear, Jira, Figma, GitHub, CI, Vercel, Slack, Mixpanel, and a stack of AI chat tabs) with a human manually carrying context across every seam.

**The cost of switching, reconciling, re-explaining, and hand-holding the work across those seams now exceeds the cost of the work itself.** Point AI tools make one seam faster (a better spec, a faster PR) but leave the operator as the glue. To remove the glue, the _substrate_ has to own the whole lifecycle, and agents must _run_ it, not just assist it.

**The deeper problem:** the scarce skill is no longer building; it is deciding what to build and knowing whether you were right. AI build tools make the cheap part cheaper and leave the operator as the glue and the sole keeper of undocumented, unaccountable judgment. Cadence removes the glue by running the whole arc end to end AND makes the judgment compound, defensible, and governed, so it out-scopes the point tools (the whole loop) rather than racing them on any single seam.

**Cadence is that substrate, the decision and outcome operating system, with the decision-and-outcome layer as its moat.** One data model, one governed agent runtime, one orchestration layer that runs the whole loop (and drives the build tools), one trust layer (the receipts), spanning sense to decide to define to build to ship to learn, running continuously and self-initiating from live signals. The decision-and-outcome layer over three pillars (own the loop, sense continuously, keep the receipts) is the moat; the build is one governed station within the loop (own engine or dispatched), not a standalone race against vibe-coding.

---

## Positioning: the closed product loop

Five statements that should never drift:

1. **The moat is the decision layer.** Cadence owns "what to build, and was it right" (no fast oracle, does not commoditize); vibe-coding owns "how to build" (racing to zero). We sit above the build tools and dispatch them. Memory is one layer of the moat, not the headline. Its engine form is the **Decision Brain**, a typed, bi-temporal decision knowledge graph (decision, evidence, outcome, supersession) with an Obsidian-style visual view, now the topmost build: [`docs/features/decision-brain.md`](./docs/features/decision-brain.md). Full canon: [`docs/strategy/moat.md`](./docs/strategy/moat.md).
2. **Agents execute; the human decides and is accountable.** Cadence agents don't just suggest; they _execute_ multi-step missions and report back. The human sets intent, approves the gates, and owns the call. Accountability is structurally human; it does not automate away.
3. **The closed, end-to-end loop.** Cadence runs the whole arc: customer signal $\rightarrow$ ranked + red-teamed decision $\rightarrow$ cited spec $\rightarrow$ build (own engine or dispatched) $\rightarrow$ ship $\rightarrow$ launch $\rightarrow$ outcome $\rightarrow$ learning, as one governed loop. factory.ai/Devin own autonomous _engineering_; Linear/Jira own _issues_; Notion owns _docs_; Lovable/Cursor own _building_, one station each. None owns the end-to-end loop, or the decision layer + the record of whether the call was right (the moat).
4. **Governed autonomy.** Every autonomous action is cited, observable in a live trace, approval-gated where it touches the outside world, and reversible. Autonomy without governance is a liability; Cadence ships both, which is what makes autonomy sellable to an enterprise.
5. **Continuous, and a force-multiplier, not a replacement.** Products never finish. Cadence makes one PM operate like a team and their judgment compound; it does not replace the PM. It gets more valuable the longer it runs (the decision memory compounds), and we monetize the decision work (credits), so we grow as decisioning gets cheaper.

### The USP

> **Cadence is the end-to-end product operating system: a swarm of specialist agents runs your whole product lifecycle, discover, decide, define, build, ship, launch, learn, as one governed loop, governed by you at the calls that matter. The moat is the decision layer (what to build, and whether the call was right) plus the compounding memory; the build is a governed station within the loop (own engine or dispatched). Vibe-coding is one station; Cadence is the whole loop, and makes the decision right.**

### The portability commitment

> **Your data is always yours.** Export everything (decisions, memory, signals, agent configs) in open formats, anytime. We earn your trust through value, not friction. See Epic U in [`docs/planning/archive/feature-backlog.md`](docs/planning/archive/feature-backlog.md).

## The MOAT: why a frontier-model launch does not kill us

**The moat is the decision layer: what to build, and whether the call was right.** Vibe-coding tools (Lovable, Cursor) own the build layer, how to build, which is racing to zero; we own the decision layer, which has no fast oracle and does not commoditize, and we dispatch the build to them (Lovable builds the wrong thing beautifully; Cadence decides and proves). The model is **not** the moat; neither is raw data; Cadence is model-agnostic, so a lab's horizontal "PM agent" is a _capability we plug in_. **Memory is one layer of the moat, not the headline.** Full articulation, competition map (integrate / absorb / race / ignore), the PM/two-phase positioning, and the YC objection Q&A: **[`docs/strategy/moat.md`](./docs/strategy/moat.md)**. The defensibility is five layers a model release cannot replicate:

1. **End-to-end lifecycle orchestration.** Owning and orchestrating the entire loop, discover $\rightarrow$ build $\rightarrow$ ship $\rightarrow$ launch $\rightarrow$ support $\rightarrow$ learn, as one governed system.
2. **The trust & governance layer.** Approval gates, full audit trail, citations, evals, guardrails, budgets, and reversibility: the part enterprises require before they let agents touch real systems.
3. **System of record _and_ system of action.** Once a product org runs its decisions, code, releases, and institutional context through Cadence, it becomes the operating layer. Ripping it out means re-gluing the lifecycle by hand.
4. **Compounding Product Memory.** The longer Cadence runs, the better the agents know your product, your users, your decisions, and your domain. This intelligence is genuinely hard to rebuild.
5. **Agent-native interop.** Cadence speaks MCP and A2A both ways. It is the place other agents plug in to act inside a governed product org.

Positioning rule: **"Cadence orchestrates the models; it does not compete with them."**

## Who Cadence is for

**Front door: the individual PM or founding PM.** Drowning in the low-judgment half of the job (writing PRDs, triaging alerts, chasing status, running meetings), and wanting the loop to take it off their plate. Entry via the **Critic teardown**: self-serve, the 10-minute wow — point Cadence at a feature you believe in, get an evidence-backed red-team with receipts. This is the viral wedge.

**Expansion: the product team.** The decision system of record for the whole team: governance, audit, shared compounding memory. Conversion from individual to team motion when the PM's manager or VP wants visibility and accountability over what the team decides and whether it paid off. This is the >$150/team/month ticket.

**Buyer: the VP or Head of Product** for the team motion. Wants the decision record, the governance layer, and the accountability story for leadership.

**Later (post-PMF):** the broader product org and adjacent stakeholders (sales, GTM, leadership consume the decision-and-outcome record in their language); regulated/compliance buyers (provenance is a purchase requirement). Full v11 persona and expansion rationale: [`docs/strategy/v11-guiding-star.md`](./docs/strategy/v11-guiding-star.md) §5.

## Six stations, one loop (the platform offering)

Cadence delivers all six stations end to end. The engine runs a 12-stage loop internally; the operator sees **six stations**, each run by named specialist agents (full mesh: 19 agents, sub-agents, handoff contract, HITL gates, in [`docs/strategy/archive/v4-feature-map.md`](./docs/strategy/archive/v4-feature-map.md)). **BUILD is a governed station** (own engine, or dispatched to Lovable / Cursor / Devin under the same governance); the un-commoditizable ends (SENSE, DECIDE, LEARN) are where the moat lives:

1. **SENSE:** Scout, Listener, Researcher, Quant ingest everything users feel, say, and do (support, meetings, reviews, analytics, competitor moves) into one cited signal stream.
2. **DECIDE:** Strategist keeps a living, re-scored opportunity queue; Critic red-teams every candidate before the human ever sees it.
3. **DEFINE:** Scribe drafts cited specs; Designer scaffolds mockups checked against design tokens; Critic stress-tests the spec.
4. **BUILD:** Planner graphs the work; Builder codes on isolated branches with CI self-correction, or delegates to Devin/Cursor/Factory-class agents under the same governance; Inspector gates quality; Releaser ships safely.
5. **LAUNCH:** Marketer drafts the full launch kit in brand voice; Pricer analyzes packaging; everything customer-visible is approval-gated.
6. **LEARN:** Support triages tickets back into signals; Quant reads outcomes; Historian writes what we learned into Product Memory, which re-ranks everything upstream.

The user-facing app is **five destinations + summonable AI + one door** (Today · Discover · Plan · Build · Brain, plus Ask (Cmd+J) and the Engine Room door + Settings); features never add nav items, and the engine never appears as navigation. IA contract: [`DESIGN-OBSIDIAN.md`](./DESIGN-OBSIDIAN.md) § 8 Information architecture.

### GTM posture (decided 2026-06-11)

**PLG wedge → enterprise.** Land with the individual senior PM via the **Critic teardown** (the 10-minute wow: point Cadence at a feature you believe in, get an evidence-backed red-team, "why your pet feature is wrong, with receipts"), then expand team → org. Self-serve is **credits-only** (managed AI credits + capped top-ups; BYOK is enterprise-only); pricing is **account-level** and gates the **decision layer** (persistent memory, Critic everywhere, governance), never the build. Credits and billing pool at the **account**, not per-workspace, the market-standard pattern for products whose value compounds with usage (Anthropic, OpenAI, Vercel, Bolt, and Replit all pool at the org/account and treat the sub-container as cost attribution); per-workspace billing would tax the very behavior that deepens our moat. Enterprise governance (SSO, audit, roles, budgets) is built into the architecture from day 1. Pain-point-first; investor framing secondary. Full model: [`docs/strategy/moat.md`](./docs/strategy/moat.md) §7 + [`docs/planning/workspace-tenancy-and-monetization-plan.md`](./docs/planning/workspace-tenancy-and-monetization-plan.md) (§2.4 the tier matrix; §4.2.1 the credit engine).

## Pluggable Multi-Model Substrate

Cadence is **model-agnostic by design.** Every AI call routes through one chokepoint (`src/lib/ai/runtime.server.ts`) that selects the best model for each task -- frontier models for reasoning and spec, fast models for classification, long-context models for ingest -- and routes around any provider outage or cost spike without touching the product interface:

| Task category | Example providers | In Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **High-context ingest** | Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude Sonnet | 1M+ token audio/transcript/support dumps (WhisperFlow) without loss |
| **High-reasoning + spec draft** | Claude Sonnet 4.6, GPT-4o | Spec drafting, Critic reasoning, roadmap planning, strategic briefs |
| **Fast intent + classification** | Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o mini | Chat intent routing, real-time dashboard updates |
| **Surgical code generation** | Claude Sonnet 4.6, DeepSeek | Build-station agent code edits, CI self-correction |

- **BYO Key (enterprise-only):** Enterprise accounts can bind their own provider API keys, encrypted at rest via AES-256-GCM in a service-role-only vault. Self-serve uses managed AI credits only. Model-agnostic routing across providers on our keys is the default. _(BYOK update 2026-06-19: enterprise-negotiated, not self-serve. See [`docs/strategy/moat.md`](./docs/strategy/moat.md) §7 and [`docs/planning/workspace-tenancy-and-monetization-plan.md`](./docs/planning/workspace-tenancy-and-monetization-plan.md) §2.6.)_

## Architecture at a glance

A request enters at the **client**, passes the **account / workspace / product tenancy** gate (where decision memory pools at the account, the compounding moat), is planned by the **orchestration layer** (which dispatches the build), every model call funnels through the **AI chokepoint** (credits-metered), and state lives in one **database**.

**Hosting, backend, and the first checkpoint.** Cadence is built on, hosted on, and published through Lovable, the live system of record for the whole project (Supabase database, auth and OAuth, edge functions, hosting, deploys, analytics, logs, source). For contributors and agents: when you hit any gap, error, log, analytics, SQL, or data question, check Lovable directly first via the connected Lovable MCP, never assume it. Secrets and env are the one local-first exception (this project's git-ignored `.env`). Standing rule: [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) §0.

Every doc cross-references the others. **Do not let them drift.** Update protocol in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md), section 5. **Before creating any new file, follow the repository map + file-placement policy in [`docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md)** (right subfolder + index link, same commit; never repo root or `docs/` top level; no duplicates/stubs).
