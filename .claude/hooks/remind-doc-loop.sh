================================================================================
⚠️  [CLOSED DOCUMENTATION LOOP WARNING]
You modified code (in src/ or supabase/migrations/) but did NOT update:
- docs/planning/feature-backlog.md (the Live status board) OR
- plan.md (the active build log)

Remember the rule from docs/archive/agent-operating-manual.md §5:
"A change is not 'done' until its documentation is true. An agent that ships
code without updating docs has left the loop open."

Please update docs/planning/feature-backlog.md and plan.md before ending your session!
