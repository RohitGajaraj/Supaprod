> **Live backend source of truth: the Lovable MCP.** OAuth, connector and client credentials, redirect URIs, and provider config are provisioned and managed by Lovable (Cadence is built on, hosted on, and published through Lovable). When wiring or debugging a connector, an OAuth flow, or any credential, read the live config from the connected Lovable MCP (`mcp__lovable__*`), and the Supabase MCP (`mcp__supabase__*`) for the underlying tables, never from assumption. Canonical rule: [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) §0.

## Principle

Cadence is **agent-first**: built to be operated by agents over open protocols, not just by humans clicking. Connectors are tools agents call through the chokepoint; every tool call is allow-listed, approval-gated where it has side effects, and logged to `tool_calls`.

## Connectors (built)

- **Google Docs** — two-way sync (`docs_links`, latest-wins + diff preview; drops comments — known limit).
- **Notion** — import to prds/opportunities/signals; export PRD → page; DB-row linking.
- **Linear** — paginated GraphQL pull → `tasks` (`external_ref`, `external_source='linear'`); push via mutation; Sync Inbox resolves conflicts (keep-local / keep-remote / merge); PRD → Linear cycle.
- **Google Calendar** — read + write (create/edit/delete, optimistic upsert into `calendar_events`); Scheduler agent proposes slots within working hours.
- **Firecrawl (web access)** — powers `web.search` / `web.fetch` / `web.map` / `web.crawl` agent tools (see [`../docs/features/web-access.md`](../docs/features/web-access.md)). Single chokepoint in `src/lib/ai/tools/firecrawl.server.ts`; results re-enter the loop as untrusted input and run through pre-guardrails on the next `callModel`. `web.crawl` defaults to `confirm` (spends real credits).
- **GitHub (issue write)** — `github.issue.create` + `prd.link_issue` agentic tools (write / `confirm`), allow-listed to a single repo resolved through `resolveGitHub` (workspace binding → user connection → `GITHUB_REPO`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` env fallback — see Connections & bindings below). Wrapped in `withIdempotency('github_issue', idempotency_key, …)` so retries / sweeper-resumes never double-create. Canonical operator guide: [`../docs/features/github-issue-approval-flow.md`](../docs/features/github-issue-approval-flow.md).

## Connections & bindings (F-CONN)

Three primitives, all in `src/lib/connectors/`:

- **`connections`** (account-level) — a user owns a provider identity: GitHub App installation, Lovable-gateway OAuth connection, or pasted API key. Own-row RLS (`auth.uid() = user_id`); managed in Settings → Connected accounts via `src/lib/connections.functions.ts`.
- **`connection_bindings`** (workspace-level) — which resource a workspace uses (e.g. which repo for the Builder). Membership RLS via `is_workspace_member`; carries `created_by` for attribution; managed on the `/sync` Connectors surface.
- **`resolveProviderAuth`** (`src/lib/connectors/resolve.server.ts`) — the ONE credential chokepoint for every external call site. Resolution chain: **workspace binding → user connection → env fallback** (e.g. `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_REPO`). Provider adapters (e.g. `providers/github.server.ts`) wrap it with provider-specific token minting.

Pasted secrets live in `connection_secrets` as ciphertext + IV only — encrypted app-layer with AES-256-GCM under `CONNECTOR_SECRETS_KEY` (wrangler secret, base64 32 bytes); the table has RLS enabled with no policies and no `authenticated` grants, so service-role is the only reader. All GitHub App / gateway env vars may be absent — every path degrades to a clean "setup pending" state instead of throwing.

**Invariant: no provider env var may be read outside `resolveProviderAuth` (the env path is a deprecated fallback).**

## BYO keys

`user_api_keys`: provider, encrypted key (app-layer AES-256-GCM under `CONNECTOR_SECRETS_KEY` — ciphertext + IV columns; replaces the earlier pgsodium design), optional base*url, label, last-test result. UI masks the key (`sk-***…last4`), supports Test (1-token completion), Rotate, Delete, all gated to the enterprise tier since WM-M9. Service-role client is the only decrypt path. Adding a provider = adding a chokepoint adapter (see [`runtime.md`](./runtime.md)), not touching call sites. *(Positioning update 2026-06-19, enforced 2026-07-03: the self-serve `user_api_keys` (BYOK) path is RETIRED (enterprise-only): `entitlements.byokAllowed` gates both the Settings UI (`saveApiKey`/`testApiKey`) and the chokepoint's vault lookup in `resolveCallKey`, so a self-serve tier never uses a saved key even if one exists from before the gate; self-serve runs on managed credits. Model-agnostic provider routing via our keys remains. See [`../docs/strategy/moat.md`](../docs/strategy/moat.md) §7.)\_

## Why managed connectors over hand-rolled OAuth

Token refresh, encrypted storage, and revoke flows are already solved by the managed connector layer. Hand-rolled OAuth (e.g. Jira/Atlassian Connect) is deferred until a use case needs it.

## Agent interop (planned — Phase 7)

The differentiator: Cadence as a node other agents plug into, and a consumer of external agents.

- **MCP server** — expose tasks, PRDs, agents, calendar, discovery, copilot as MCP tools at `src/routes/api/mcp.ts`; per-user scoped `mcp_tokens`; config snippets for Claude Desktop / Cursor / ChatGPT. Every invocation logs `surface='mcp_server'`.
- **MCP client** — register external servers (`mcp_servers`), cache catalogs (`mcp_server_tools`), per-agent allow-listed tools; destructive calls reuse the approval gates.
- **A2A** — Agent Cards at `/.well-known/agent.json`; A2A server (`message/send`, `message/stream`, `tasks/*`) with `a2a_tasks`/`a2a_messages`; A2A client with `delegate_to_agent`, `a2a_peers` registry; multi-agent DAG stitched into `ai_events` via `trace_id` / `parent_event_id` (this said `ai_traces` until 2026-08-20; that table does not exist).
- **Unified protocol gateway** (`src/lib/protocols/`) reuses the Phase 6 auth/tracing/guardrails substrate — no second runtime.

## Interop safety (Phase 7)

Capability scopes per token/peer; per-tool rate limits; **prompt-injection guard on external server results** (treat external output as untrusted input through the pre-guardrails); PII egress check; `protocol_audit` log.

## Invariants

- Every external tool call routes through the chokepoint and logs to `tool_calls`.
- Destructive external actions require approval.
- External results are untrusted input — guard them.
- Model providers are connectors too: model-agnostic by contract.

## Outbound observability (AFD, planned · founder-gated)

Three outbound integrations land with the [AFD initiative](../docs/planning/initiatives/analytics-and-failure-detection-plan.md), all behind the `src/lib/observability/` façade:

- **PostHog EU** — `track`/`identify`/`pageView` (product usage + replay + flags). AFD-04.
- **Sentry EU** — `captureError`/`captureMessage`/`setUser`/`setTag` + Worker performance (errors + perf). AFD-05.
- **Better Stack** — `heartbeat(jobName)` + external uptime probes against `/api/public/health` + on-call escalation + status page at `status.cadence.app` (renameable). AFD-08 + AFD-13.

The façade rule (no vendor SDK imports outside `src/lib/observability/`) means swapping any vendor is a 1-file edit and leaving Lovable stays a ~1-day redeploy. Doctrine: [`../docs/strategy/build-buy-integrate.md`](../docs/strategy/build-buy-integrate.md). Vendor ADR: [`../docs/decisions/analytics-vendor-selection.md`](../docs/decisions/analytics-vendor-selection.md).
