# architecture/frontend.md — Frontend patterns contract

> _Created: 2026-06-03 · Last updated: 2026-06-19_

> TanStack Start patterns. Rules: [`AGENTS.md`](../docs/archive/agent-operating-manual.md). UI/visual contract: [`docs/design/archive/obsidian-v3.md`](../docs/design/archive/obsidian-v3.md) (app surfaces, v3 "Obsidian", adopted 2026-07-02; the live parchment styles in `src/styles.css` are legacy until surfaces are ported) · [`docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md`](../docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md) (landing page). Data: [`data.md`](./data.md).

## Stack

TanStack Start v1 (React 19 + Vite 7) on Cloudflare Workers (`nodejs_compat`), TailwindCSS v4, shadcn/ui (Radix), Framer Motion, Tiptap, Lucide. Canonical runtime: Bun.

`vite.config.ts` is load-bearing for published builds: it keeps the custom SSR error-wrapper entry and explicitly injects the public backend URL/key into `import.meta.env`. The config uses Vite `loadEnv(...)` at module evaluation plus checked-in public fallbacks because Lovable publish builds may not expose these values on `process.env` early enough for config-time `define` replacement. Without that public injection, protected pages hydrate into the root error boundary before the auth redirect runs. It also excludes TanStack Start's isomorphic core from dev dependency optimization so the plugin can preserve the client/server split; pre-bundling that core can load server async-storage code in the browser and blank the preview.

Public auth routes (`/login`, `/signup`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`) are client-only (`ssr: false`) because their route gates read browser auth state and may redirect after local session inspection. Keeping them SSR-rendered can make the server tree differ from the hydrated browser tree after `/` redirects to `/login`, which blanks the preview.

## Server boundary

- **App logic = `createServerFn` (RPC).** Type-safe, plain function calls.
- **Cron-poked endpoints = `/api/public/hooks/*`** server routes (anon-key auth), poked by `pg_cron`.
- **SSE endpoints** for streaming (`api/chat.ts`, `api/studio-chat.ts`). SSE over WebSockets because Workers stream SSE natively and we never need client→server mid-stream; reconnect uses `Last-Event-ID`.
- Service-role Supabase client is server-only (see [`data.md`](./data.md)).

## Data fetching — the one pattern

**Loader + Suspense, never `useEffect + fetch`** for initial render.

```
loader: context.queryClient.ensureQueryData(queryOptions)
component: useSuspenseQuery(queryOptions)
```

Mutations are optimistic where it helps (chat send, task toggle, decision approve). Streaming state belongs in the route loader + Suspense, not a hidden `useEffect`.

## Route boundaries — on every route

- `errorComponent` with a retry that calls both `router.invalidate()` and `reset()`.
- `notFoundComponent`.
- Root-level `defaultErrorComponent`.
  Stack traces never leak to the UI. Long operations link to `/traces/$traceId` instead of inlining raw errors.

## State persistence

`localStorage` for UI state only (active workspace/project, sidebar open/closed under `cadence.nav.open`). Never business data.

## Components

shadcn/ui primitives; bespoke in `src/components/cadence/`. The shared AI-message component renders the full [AI message contract](../docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md) — no surface invents its own. Tokens only, never hex (see [`docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md`](../docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md)).

## Realtime & streaming

Supabase Realtime on `agent_runs` (cockpit feed); SSE on chat/studio; trace waterfalls update live. Streaming text uses a CSS cursor, not Framer (high-frequency Framer animation janks).

## Keyboard-first

⌘K command palette (`cmdk`) resolves every destination, create action, and recent artifact. Every interactive surface has a keyboard equivalent.

## Invariants

- No `useEffect+fetch` for initial render.
- No service-role import in client code.
- Every route has error + not-found boundaries.
- App logic is a server fn; cron is a public hook — do not blur the two.

## Observe surface (Run group)

`/observe` is a redirect surface since F-IA-V4 Phase 1b. It forwards `?tab=analytics|traces|drift` to `/govern?tab=…` so bookmarks survive. `/traces/$traceId` is preserved untouched and is the deep-link target from the Traces tab. Panel JSX for Analytics, Traces, and Drift lives in `src/components/observe/{Analytics,Traces,Drift}Panel.tsx` and mounts inside the Govern surface. The sidebar group is `Run` (Observe · Evals) — Evals stays separate because authoring ≠ observation.

## Governance surface (Govern group)

`/govern` follows the same tabs pattern as the merged surfaces. One page, **ten tabs** with outcome-named labels per the Engine-Room Doctrine (the `?tab=<id>` ids are the routing contract and stay unchanged; only the display label changed, applied 2026-06-16): Controls (kill switch · mission caps · stuck approvals · reactor) · Approvals (tool-call queue) · **Safety** (id `guardrails`, content rules) · **Spend** (id `budgets`, spend caps) · Prompts (prompt studio) · **Quality checks** (id `evals`, eval suite) · Analytics (run metrics) · **Loop health** (id `gauntlet`, the proof metrics) · **Activity** (id `traces`, execution waterfall) · **Trends** (id `drift`, model drift). The surface header reads **Engine Room** (matching the Trust-row door); the route id stays `/govern`. See [`../docs/conventions/engine-room-doctrine.md`](../docs/conventions/engine-room-doctrine.md). Tab state is `?tab=controls|approvals|guardrails|budgets|prompts|evals|analytics|traces|drift` via `validateSearch`, default `controls`. Panel JSX lives in `src/components/governance/{Approvals,Guardrails,Budgets,Evals,Prompts}Panel.tsx`; Analytics, Traces, and Drift panels live in `src/components/observe/` and are reused here. The Controls panel stays inline in the route file because it depends on the same `getGovernanceOverview` + reactor server fns. Legacy routes `/inbox`, `/guardrails`, `/budgets`, `/evals`, `/prompts`, `/analytics`, `/traces`, `/drift`, and `/observe` are all `beforeLoad`-redirects to the matching Govern tab. Sidebar workspace rail's "Approvals" deep-links to `/govern?tab=approvals` — `NavRow` forwards a per-item `search` prop to `<Link>`, and `AppShell.isItemActive` checks the current `search.tab` so a path can host multiple correctly-highlighted nav entries. Govern group ships with two items only: Governance, Integrations.

## Pinned workspace rail

The pinned (always-visible) rail in `AppShell` holds **two** items: **Today · Ask** — the surfaces touched every minute. **`Ask`** is the chat surface (route stays `/chat`) that queries the Brain; it was renamed from "Brain" when the Knowledge surface took the name **Brain** (founder ruling 2026-06-16: the knowledge substrate owns the word "brain", the query interface is "Ask"). Below it the **Loop** group lists **Product · Build · Missions · Brain** — the old top-level **Memory** nav item was folded into Brain as its "Memory" tab (see Brain section below). The Pin test (see [`../docs/conventions/inline-management.md`](../docs/conventions/inline-management.md#pin-test-applies-to-the-sidebars-pinned-workspace-rail)) governs what earns a pin. A **floating quick-access dock** (bottom-right, `z-50`, hidden on mobile) exposes **Calendar** → `/knowledge?tab=calendar` with a hover tooltip. **Single-sourced Approvals (Phase-2 IA de-dup, founder ruling 2026-06-16):** Approvals appears exactly once in the sidebar — in the footer **Trust** row, deep-linking to `/govern?tab=approvals` and carrying a live pending-call badge (the count pop-up). It was removed from both the daily rail and the dock so it lives in the Trust governance cluster, where it reads best, without taking a rail slot. The **Trust** row is therefore **Approvals (badged) · Spend · Engine Room · Connectors**. **Connectors** → `/sync` owns the workspace-level resource bindings + sync-conflict resolution; it is distinct from **Settings → Accounts** (the account-level OAuth provider logins, renamed from "Connections" in the same Phase-2 de-collision so the two near-identical names no longer clash). Calendar is also the **default tab of `/knowledge` (Brain)** (see Brain section below), so the swarm has one substrate (memory + learnings + decisions + docs + events) to pull threads from; the dock is the fast path, the Brain Calendar tab is the home. Everything else lives inside a collapsible group, inside a parent surface (tab / sheet / inline section), or in Settings.

## Global ambient bar

`src/components/cadence/AmbientChip.tsx` renders once in `_authenticated.tsx`, above the routed page outlet, as a slim sticky strip so content flows below it instead of being covered. It shows local time, location, and current weather on every authenticated screen. Weather loading is progressive: browser geolocation first, network-derived location second, timezone-derived city last, then Open-Meteo weather. The weather pill uses semantic utilities from `src/styles.css` (`.ambient-weather--sunny`, `--rain`, `--snow`, etc.) so the temperature/icon stays visible across themes without hardcoded component colors. Cache is UI-only localStorage (`cadence.ambient.v3`) and stores only the last place/weather payload.

## Brain surface (Memory + Learnings + Decisions + Docs + Calendar)

`/knowledge` is the consolidated **Brain** surface — the product's brain, the one substrate of everything it knows (founder ruling 2026-06-16: Knowledge → **Brain**, positioned in copy as the "Product brain"; route stays `/knowledge`). One page, **five** tabs: **Calendar** (default — events + meeting transcripts in one feed) · **Memory** (the compounding agent-recall **moat** — what the loop wrote and reaches for again; this is the old top-level `/memory` surface folded in, rendering the same `<MemoryList />`, `agent_memory` data) · **Learnings** (the human-recorded outcome learnings, `MemoryPanel` over the `learnings` table) · **Decisions** (workspace decisions log) · **Docs** (workspace pages, Notion / Google Docs import). Tab state via `validateSearch` (`?tab=calendar|memory|learnings|decisions|docs`), default `calendar`. **Tab-id history:** the `memory` id now belongs to the agent-recall Memory tab; the Learnings tab (which briefly held `id=memory` after the Phase-2 de-collision) was re-id'd to `learnings`, and its deep links (`LearningDetail` back, `MemoryPanel` row open, Today's "What changed" tile) were re-pointed to `?tab=learnings`. The legacy `/memory` route is a `beforeLoad`-redirect to `/knowledge?tab=memory`. The Calendar panel preserves the meeting deep-link sheet via a sibling `?meeting=<id>` search param that the route forwards as a prop to `CalendarPanel`; the Learnings tab uses `?learning=<id>` for `LearningDetail`. Panel JSX lives in `src/components/knowledge/{Calendar,Memory,Decisions,Docs}Panel.tsx` (the Memory tab reuses `src/components/memory/MemoryList.tsx`). Calendar reuses `listCalendarEvents`, `listMeetings`, `syncCalendar`, `createCalendarEvent`, `updateCalendarEvent`, `deleteCalendarEvent`, `proposeSlots`, and the per-user connect server fns unchanged. Legacy routes `/calendar`, `/docs`, `/meetings`, `/meetings/$id` are `beforeLoad`-redirects into the matching tab.

**Decisions panel (`F-DECISIONS-CAPTURE`).** The Decisions tab reads `listDecisions` (workspace-scoped, source-hydrated labels for missions / specs / meetings) with optional `{ source, status, q }` filters. UI: source filter chips (All · Meetings · Missions · Specs · Manual), status filter chips (All · Pending · Approved · Rejected), title search, "Log decision" dialog for manual capture, list rows with source badge + status pill + age + "Open source" deep link, side sheet for full rationale + approve/reject/pending toggles. **Sources writing to `decisions`:** (a) `extractMeeting` writes one row per AI-extracted decision with `source_kind='meeting'` and `meeting_id` set; (b) `maybeCompleteMission` in `src/lib/ai/handoff.server.ts` writes one `approved` decision per completed mission (`source_kind='mission'`, idempotent on `mission_id`, rationale = final hop output); (c) `savePrd` in `src/lib/discovery.functions.ts` writes one `approved` decision on PRD status flip to `approved` (`source_kind='prd'`, idempotent on `prd_id`, rationale = first 500 chars of body); (d) manual entry from the Decisions tab or the "Capture as decision" button on mission detail / PRD detail (`source_kind` derived from whichever id is set, defaults to `'manual'`). Schema: `decisions` carries `mission_id`, `prd_id`, `meeting_id`, `source_kind` (CHECK in `meeting|mission|prd|manual`), `decided_by_agent_slug`. RLS: workspace-scoped via `is_workspace_member(workspace_id)`; writes set `user_id = auth.uid()`.

## Learn surface (Outcomes + Support + Learnings)

`/learn` closes the loop between what shipped, what came back, and what to do next. Three tabs: **Outcomes** (Growth-agent drafts queued behind approval — changelogs, announcements, Slack posts) · **Support** (inbound from connected channels, triaged back into Product → Signals) · **Learnings** (re-scored opportunities and outcome memos). Tab state via `validateSearch` (`?tab=outcomes|support|learnings`), default `outcomes`. Panel JSX lives in `src/components/learn/{Outcomes,Support,Learnings}Panel.tsx`; all three read from the existing `getOutcomeData` server fn — Releases moved to `/product/releases` in Phase 1c, so it is not a Learn tab. Legacy route `/outcome` is a `beforeLoad`-redirect to `/learn?tab=outcomes`.

## Strategic brief (inline in Settings)

The workspace's strategic brief — read by every agent mission — is **not** a top-level route. It lives as an inline section in `/settings`, deep-linked via `/settings?section=brief` (validated via `validateSearch`; the section scrolls into view and ring-highlights when the param is present). Reuses `getActiveBrief` / `upsertBrief` unchanged. Legacy `/briefing` is a `beforeLoad`-redirect to `/settings?section=brief`. This follows the inline-management convention: workspace-scoped settings live next to the workspace.

## Confirmation, toasts & dialogs

Canonical rule: [`../docs/conventions/ui-chrome.md`](../docs/conventions/ui-chrome.md). This section is the contract restatement.

No native browser chrome. `window.alert`, `window.confirm`, `window.prompt`, `window.open`, and `window.onbeforeunload` are banned in `src/**` and fail ESLint (`no-restricted-globals` + `no-restricted-syntax` in `eslint.config.js`). The single allow-listed exception is `src/lib/error-page.ts` (pre-bootstrap fallback only).

Use instead:

- **Confirm / typed-name confirm** — `useConfirm()` from [`src/hooks/use-confirm.tsx`](../src/hooks/use-confirm.tsx). Promise-based, themed shadcn `AlertDialog`, focus-trapped. Pass `destructive: true` for delete flows, `typedConfirm: name` for irreversible ones.
- **One-field prompt** — `usePrompt()` from the same module. For richer inputs build a proper shadcn `Dialog`.
- **Non-blocking feedback** — `toast.success` / `toast.error` from `sonner`. Never use toasts for errors that require attention (use an inline `Alert` instead — see [`docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md`](../docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md) anti-patterns).
- **Unsaved-changes guards** — TanStack Router `useBlocker` wired to `useConfirm`.

`ConfirmProvider` is mounted once in `src/routes/__root.tsx` inside `ThemeProvider`. Voice rules for the strings these primitives render live in [`docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md`](../docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md) and the audit at [`../docs/strategy/archive/v3-audit-language-voice.md`](../docs/strategy/archive/v3-audit-language-voice.md).

## Inline workspace & product management

Canonical rule: [`../docs/conventions/inline-management.md`](../docs/conventions/inline-management.md). This section is the contract restatement.

Operators never leave the current surface to administer a workspace or product. The `AppShell` top-left switcher is a popover, not a route.

- **Switcher actions:** Switch · Rename · Workspace settings · Leave · Delete. All inline.
- **Product row actions:** `MoreHorizontal` dropdown next to each product row — Set active · Rename · Delete. No bare destructive icons.
- **Destructive flows:** typed-name match (`typedConfirm`) for delete workspace + delete product.
- **Server functions:** [`src/lib/workspaces.functions.ts`](../src/lib/workspaces.functions.ts) (`renameWorkspace`, `deleteWorkspace`, `leaveWorkspace`, `listWorkspaceMembers`, `removeWorkspaceMember`) and `updateProject` in [`src/lib/projects.functions.ts`](../src/lib/projects.functions.ts). All `requireSupabaseAuth`; owner-gated via RLS. Owner cannot leave their own workspace (server-side guard, surfaced as a toast).
- **Invalidation:** mutate → `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: [...] })`. Never `window.location.reload()` or hard navigations — switching workspace must not blank the screen.

Rule: any "manage X" affordance lives next to X or in a sheet over the current page, never on a separate route.
