# ENTRY.md — Where do I start?

> _Created: 2026-06-03 · Last updated: 2026-07-10_

> You just opened Supaprod. This file routes you. Supaprod is the **B2B Enterprise Product Cockpit** — an agent-native system of record and action where a swarm of specialist agents runs the entire product lifecycle (discover → definition → plan → build → test → ship → GTM launch → support → cohort analytics → learning loop) and a human governs the calls that matter. Agents execute. Humans govern. Full thesis: [`README.md`](./README.md). Strategic positioning: [`docs/strategy/`](./docs/strategy/) — always read the latest version file there before any positioning, feature, or UX work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **PRODUCT NAME: SUPAPROD.** The product is **Supaprod**, and that is the only name to use. A brief 2026-06-10 rename experiment to a different brand was reverted on 2026-06-16; the retired name must not be reintroduced anywhere (code, docs, DB, env, caches, APIs). Any stray legacy token from that experiment is to be read as equivalent to `supaprod`/`Supaprod`.

**One rule of rules:** operating rules live once, in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md). `CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code) and `GEMINI.md` (Antigravity + Gemini CLI) are thin pointers + tool-specific overrides only. Change a rule in `AGENTS.md`.

## The thirty-second pitch

Building software is no longer the bottleneck — product judgment under fragmented context is. Signals live in 6 places, reasoning in 4 more, planning in 3, execution in 5. The cost of switching, reconciling, and re-explaining now exceeds the cost of the work. Supaprod collapses the lifecycle into one queryable substrate where agents cite their evidence, prove their reasoning, and act behind approval gates. **Agent-first, not a PM tool with AI bolted on.** Full thesis: [`README.md`](./README.md).

---

## First steps for a contributor

```bash
bun install      # canonical runtime
bun run dev       # dev server
# open http://localhost:5173
```

Environment is auto-provisioned by the cloud project (Supabase URL/key + AI gateway key injected). That cloud project is **Lovable**: Supaprod is built on, hosted on, and published through Lovable, which provisions and manages the backend (Supabase DB, auth/OAuth, secrets, hosting, deploys). Read any live backend, OAuth, or database fact from the connected Lovable MCP (`mcp__lovable__*`), and the Supabase MCP (`mcp__supabase__*`) for direct DB reads, never assume it. Standing rule: [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) §0. Migrations live in `supabase/migrations/` — author new ones via the migration tool; never edit existing migrations in place. Commits go through `gstack` ([`docs/operations/commits.md`](./docs/operations/commits.md)).

---

## The first golden rule

**Scan skills, agents, plugins, and MCPs first — then act.** Before any task: surface candidates across all four categories from the session context; pick the best fit across all namespaces with no vendor bias; invoke before acting from scratch. Also read the latest positioning file in [`docs/strategy/`](./docs/strategy/) before any feature, UX, or positioning decision. Full protocol: [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) §1 and §2.

## When you ship a change

Update the right docs — matrix in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md), section 5. Headline: **change capability scope without updating both `README.md` and `plan.md` and you have created drift.**

> **Last word.** One repo, one canonical rules file, one runtime chokepoint, one design system, one operating model. If a change does not fit that picture, the change is probably wrong. If the picture does not fit the change, evolve the picture — in the docs, openly, before the code lands.
