/**
 * IA-NAV-V11 (v11 #12) — the pure navigation model for the app shell.
 *
 * The left nav had four competing metaphors stacked on top of each other: a
 * "Workspace" daily rail (Today · Ask), a labelled "Loop" section fed through a
 * vestigial NavGroup indirection (Product · Build · Missions · Brain), a 5-icon
 * "Trust" row in the footer (Approvals · Spend · Engine Room · Trust Ledger ·
 * Connectors), and a floating QuickAccessDock (Calendar). This module flattens
 * that to ONE calm list of outcome-named destinations + ONE recessed Engine Room
 * door that reveals the governance/engine surfaces on demand (the engine-room
 * doctrine: calm front, deep engine behind one door). The dock is gone — Calendar
 * is reached from the Brain surface and the ⌘K palette.
 *
 * PURE: data + active-state math only, no JSX. The shell renders these; the
 * invariants (the destinations are flat + unique, no engine-room surface is
 * orphaned, active-state matching) are unit-verified.
