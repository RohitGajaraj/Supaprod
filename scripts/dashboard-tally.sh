#!/usr/bin/env bash
# dashboard-tally.sh — recompute the feature-dashboard "At a glance" tally from the rows.
#
# WHY: the headline completion %, status counts, and by-priority counts are DERIVED from
# the register rows, not hand-kept. They must be refreshed in the SAME commit as every
# status flip so the dashboard is live for the founder and for every lane (founder ruling
# 2026-06-24: the headline was drifting because lanes flipped a row but never recomputed).
# This prints the exact numbers to write into the headline; it is deterministic, so on a
# rebase you just re-run it and overwrite the headline block (the numbers are never merged
# by hand). It does NOT reorder rows (that is the conflict-heavy `rerank-dashboard.py`,
# kept as a periodic reconcile) — it only reads the current rows and tallies.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/dashboard-tally.sh        (from the repo root)
