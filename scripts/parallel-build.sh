# parallel-build.sh - FALLBACK launcher for the parallel build lanes.
#
# PREFERRED WAY (2026-06-20): run lanes in the VS Code INTEGRATED TERMINAL, not a
# separate macOS Terminal window. Use the "Lane N" VS Code tasks (Cmd+Shift+P ->
# Tasks: Run Task) or open cadence-parallel.code-workspace and right-click a lane
# folder -> Open in Integrated Terminal, then type /loop with the lane cycle
# prompt. This script (which pops a separate Terminal/iTerm window via osascript)
# remains only for non-VS-Code use. See docs/operations/parallel-build.md.
#
# Each lane runs the autonomous /loop in its own git worktree, scoped by that
# worktree's .remember/LANE.md (docs/operations/autonomous-build-loop.md s15-16).
# Choosing a lane = choosing which worktree gets a terminal.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/parallel-build.sh            # interactive numbered menu
#   ./scripts/parallel-build.sh cockpit    # open one lane (wm|cockpit|knowledge|safety|build)
#   ./scripts/parallel-build.sh a          # open every NON-wm lane (one window each)
#   ./scripts/parallel-build.sh list       # just print each lane's launch command (no opening)
#
# Each opened session AUTO-STARTS the loop via a bootstrap prompt. (Verified CLI
# fact: a slash command cannot be passed at launch - `claude "/overnight-build"`
# only seeds text - so we pass a natural-language instruction that invokes the
# overnight-build skill.) macOS only for auto-open: iTerm (if present), else
# Terminal.app. Non-macOS / no osascript -> it prints the command to paste.
#
# Reliability: opens a NEW WINDOW per lane (titled), which is race-free and needs
# no Accessibility permission (a forced new TAB would need the cmd+t keystroke +
# Accessibility). The osascript uses the `on run argv` form so the spaced path is
# passed as a runtime arg and never crosses AppleScript-source quoting. Verified:
# Terminal path on macOS 26.5 / Terminal 2.15. iTerm path uses the current
# documented API (treat as documented-not-run if iTerm is absent).

set -uo pipefail   # NOT -e: an interactive read returning non-zero must not kill us.

BOOTSTRAP='You are a NUMBERED parallel build lane in THIS worktree. Read .remember/LANE.md and docs/operations/autonomous-build-loop.md sections 15-16 plus AGENTS.md section 3, then run as a CONTINUOUS autonomous loop (equivalent to /loop) IN THIS TERMINAL. NO CATEGORY and NO OWNED/FORBIDDEN area: you build the single highest-RANKED free item regardless of theme. Each cycle: git fetch + rebase origin/main; bash scripts/lane.sh reap; SELECT MECHANICALLY by running bash scripts/lane.sh next (it prints the eligible items by Rank) and CLAIM DOWN the list, building the FIRST whose claim wins: for id in $(bash scripts/lane.sh next); do bash scripts/lane.sh claim "$id" <laneN> "<globs>" && break; done. The claim auto-rejects HELD, CONFLICT, and DONE (including chokepoint-pinned files), so you never collide or redo finished work. ANTI-DUPLICATION (founder ruling 2026-06-22): always claim the EXACT REGISTER-ROW id lane.sh next printed, never a private sub-id (a sub-id leaves the whole item still showing eligible to other lanes, so a second lane re-picks it; lane.sh claim WARNs on a non-register id). A partial (half-circle) item is PARTIAL with remaining work: CONTINUE it, never skip it as done or publish-verify-only. After a successful CLAIMED, flip the dashboard row to In Dev and commit + push that claim immediately. Build; gate (bunx tsc --noEmit + bun run build + tests); adversarially review; run the doc-loop; commit explicit paths with a WHY; push. The In Dev dashboard status is the cross-tool lock - lane.sh next (and Lovable) skip any row not status open/partial - so KEEP the row In Dev for EVERY increment you build on that item and keep the claim held (heartbeat it); flip to done/partial + run bash scripts/lane.sh done/release <ID> ONLY when you PIVOT to a DIFFERENT register item. If your next increment is the SAME item, do not release and do not flip back - just commit and continue. If a claimed item has NO autonomous work left (only publish-verify, or the remainder is founder-gated), run bash scripts/lane.sh done <ID> to retire it from the board, then take the next. Never stop after one build. The board is dry ONLY when bash scripts/lane.sh next prints nothing; only then write "board dry - long-polling" and recheck in ~25 min. Never hard-stop; never fence yourself to a category.'
