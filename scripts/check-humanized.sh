# check-humanized.sh build-time guard for the humanized-output convention.
#
# Scans ADDED lines (lines a diff prefixes with +) of staged TEXT files and
# flags AI fingerprints the convention bans: the em dash (U+2014), the en dash
# (U+2013), and the invisible / look-alike character set
# (U+200B U+200C U+200D U+2060 U+FEFF U+00A0 U+202F U+00AD U+200E U+200F U+FFFD).
# Convention: docs/conventions/humanized-output.md ("Banned fingerprints").
#
# This is the deferred build-time half of that convention. The runtime half
# (humanizeText at the AI chokepoint) already ships in src/lib/ai/humanize.ts.
#
# Scope: staged TEXT files only (*.md, *.ts, *.tsx, *.sql). It best-effort skips
# obvious code so a legitimate dash inside a sample is not flagged: fenced
# triple-backtick (or triple-tilde) blocks, and inline `backtick` code spans on
# the same line.
#
# WARN-ONLY by default. It always exits 0 and prints a warning, so it can never
# block a commit or a session. Set STRICT=1 to make it exit non-zero when it
# finds a hit (for a CI gate or an opt-in blocking pre-commit hook).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-humanized.sh                 # scan the staged diff (warn-only)
#   STRICT=1 scripts/check-humanized.sh        # same, but exit 1 on any hit
#   scripts/check-humanized.sh path/a.md b.ts  # scan specific files (whole file)
#
# When given file arguments it scans every line of those files (not a diff), so
# you can check a file before staging it. With no arguments it scans the staged
# diff (git diff --cached) and reports file:line for each added hit.
#
# Detection engine: perl with -CSD (decode stdin as UTF-8), so the banned set is
# matched as Unicode codepoints. This is portable across macOS (BSD grep has no
# PCRE) and Linux. Input arrives as "<lineno>\t<content>" pairs on stdin.

# Generated artifacts we commit but do not author. graphify builds graphify-out/wiki/*.md and
