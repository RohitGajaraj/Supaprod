-- M-C: memory expiry (the monetization mechanic from v7 section 9).
--
-- Free workspaces keep distilled memory for 14 days, then it expires; pro/team
-- keep it forever. This is the core "charge for memory persistence" gate (founder
-- course-correction #3). Depends on workspaces.plan_tier (migration 20260616200000,
-- which applies first).
--
-- Design: a BEFORE INSERT trigger stamps expires_at from the OWNER's plan, so the
-- TS write path is unchanged and stays pre-migration tolerant (until this applies
-- the column does not exist and no code references it). The recall RPC hard-filters
-- expired rows, and memory-tick (the daily cron) hard-deletes them. Existing rows
-- are grandfathered (expires_at stays NULL = never expires) so the feature never
-- retroactively wipes anyone's memory, including the demo seed.

ALTER TABLE public.agent_memory
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS expires_at timestamptz;

-- Partial index: the recall filter and the sweep only ever look at non-null rows.
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS agent_memory_expires_at_idx
  ON public.agent_memory (expires_at)
  WHERE expires_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Dormancy flag (founder ruling 2026-06-16): the expiry enforcement ships BUILT
-- but OFF at the prototype stage, so no plan gate actually bites yet. While this
-- returns false the trigger never stamps expires_at, so every row stays NULL =
-- never expires, and the recall filter + the memory-tick sweep are automatic
-- no-ops (nothing ever has a non-null expires_at to filter or delete). To ENABLE
-- later: CREATE OR REPLACE this to `SELECT true` in a one-line migration.
