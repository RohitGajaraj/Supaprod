# U6 · Workspace data export (data portability)

> _Created: 2026-06-18 · Last updated: 2026-06-18_

> Status · ✅ **LIVE-VERIFIED END-TO-END on the published app 2026-06-22** (Lane 1). Core shipped 2026-06-18 (cycle 1); audit log + Recent-exports history UI added (cycles 48/52). Route: `/settings?section=data` · Owner: operator-triggered.
>
> Live verify (Playwright, demo account, commit 662b5aec): Settings → Data → "Export your data" renders the per-section wizard (Products, Signals, Opportunities & decisions, Specs, Tasks, Outcomes, Agent memory) + "Download workspace export" + "Recent exports". Clicking download actually produced `cadence-workspace-export-2026-06-21.json` (483 KB) whose JSON carries `workspace_id`, `exported_by`, `exported_at`, a `counts` summary, and every section — projects:2, signals:9, opportunities:5, specs:2, tasks:9, learnings:1, memory:23 — exactly matching the demo workspace seed, i.e. RLS-scoped to the caller's workspace. The whole data-portability round-trip works in production.

## What it does

One click in Settings > Data downloads the entire workspace as a single JSON file: every project, signal, opportunity (carrying its decision and Critic review), spec, task, outcome (learning), and the user's agent memory. It is the trust escape-hatch and the no-lock-in promise made real: your data, yours to keep or move anywhere.

## Why it exists

Data portability is a trust requirement, not a nicety: a PM will not pour their product thinking into a tool they cannot get it back out of. It complements B5 (per-product export) by exporting the whole workspace footprint at once. Build note: [`plan.md`](../../plan.md) §4.

## Where to find it

Settings (`/settings`) > the **Data** tab > "Download workspace export".

## Demo script (<= 90s)

1. Open Settings, click the **Data** tab.
2. Read the one-line promise: everything in this workspace, yours, no lock-in.
3. Click **Download workspace export**. A `cadence-workspace-export-<date>.json` file downloads.
4. Open it: a single JSON object with per-section arrays and a `counts` summary, plus `workspace_id`, `exported_by`, and `exported_at`.

## How it works

- `exportWorkspace` server fn in `src/lib/projects.functions.ts` (mirrors B5 `exportProduct` at workspace scope). GET, `requireSupabaseAuth` middleware.
- Resolves the active workspace (passed from the client, falling back to the user's first membership).
- Gathers projects by `workspace_id`; signals / opportunities / specs (`prds`) / tasks by `project_id` across the workspace's projects (guarded so a workspace with no projects never issues an empty `in()` query); the user's own `learnings` and `agent_memory` by `user_id`.
- Returns a JSON-safe shape with a `counts` map. RLS scopes every read to the caller, so it can only ever export the user's own rows.
- `DataExportCard.tsx` in `src/components/settings/` consumes the fn, serializes to a Blob, and triggers a download; it toasts the total record count.
- **Export history (front-end pivot, cycle 52):** the same card shows a "Recent exports" list (date+time · kind · row count) read from `listExportLog` (the append-only `export_log` audit table, U6-AUDIT cycle 48); a successful export refetches it (`invalidateQueries(["export-log"])`) so the new entry appears at once. The audit row is written best-effort by `exportProduct`/`exportWorkspace` (never fails the export). Live rows accrue on the founder's publish (the `export_log` migration applies then); pre-publish the list shows a calm empty state.

## Governance & guardrails

- Read-only. No writes, no migration.
- RLS-scoped to the caller; a user can only export their own rows even if they pass another workspace's id.
- Calm-front: the surface names the outcome ("Export your data"), not the mechanism, and exposes no engine internals.

## Verification checklist

- [x] `tsc --noEmit` clean, `eslint` clean, `bun run build` green (2026-06-18).
- [x] Adversarial review folded: empty-projects `.in()` guard; active-workspace-id pass-through.
- [ ] **Pending published-app verification (needs the founder to publish first):** open Settings > Data on the live app, download the export, confirm the JSON contains the expected sections with non-zero counts on a seeded workspace, and confirm a second workspace's data is not present.

## Known limits / out of scope

- Per-section selective export shipped (cycle 6): the card has checkboxes to choose which sections to include (output-filtered server-side). Remaining: an export audit-log (and richer format choices). Tracked as the partial remainder on the U6 dashboard row.
- The standalone `decisions` and `lineage` edge tables are not yet exported separately (decisions travel with opportunities and specs via `critic_review`); a documented fast-follow.

## Settings/connections audit note (2026-07-07)

Reviewed in the `settings_connections` consumer/enterprise-grade pass. The `DataExportCard` (Settings > Data) already meets the bar: real data (RLS-scoped `exportWorkspace` + `export_log` history), calm-front outcome naming, and proper empty/loading states. No functional or design change was needed; the sibling bindings/connections surfaces on the same route are where that pass landed (see [`settings-ia.md`](./settings-ia.md) "Design + first-class-object pass").
