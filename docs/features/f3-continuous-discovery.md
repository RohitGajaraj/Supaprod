> Live verify (Playwright, demo account, commit 662b5aec): switching to the Lumen product renders the per-product clustered feed with real data — a THEME / EVIDENCE / SOURCES / FRESH / CONF table of Scout-clustered themes ("Slow first-response on Tier-1 tickets · 3 items · intercom·slack·csat · conf 82", "Unsafe escalation on refund/legal · conf 91", "Tone too formal for SMB customers · conf 74", plus unclustered items), per-source attribution, freshness dates, confidence scores, "Cluster N · Scout themes them", and a "Draft spec" action per theme. The auto-cluster cron toggle renders in its gated state ("On · awaiting first run"). The BUILD is complete and proven live; the only remainder is the founder activating the auto-cluster cron (it commits recurring AI spend, so it ships gated off by design — not a build gap).

## What it does

The discovery surface keeps the signal feed live and lets each product own its own feed:

1. **Always-fresh feed (cycle 11).** Signals stream in continuously through the ingest webhook and the reactor; the Signals tab polls every 30s (pausing when the tab is unfocused, only while mounted), so newly-ingested signals appear without a manual reload.
2. **Per-product clustering (cycle 17).** When a product is active in the switcher, the signals feed, the themes, and the clustering all scope to that product, so each product gets its own discovery feed instead of one workspace-wide pile. With no product active (the all-products view), the feed is the full unscoped one, exactly as before.
3. **Auto-cluster cron (opt-in).** A workspace owner can turn on "Auto-cluster new signals" so the loop re-clusters their unclustered signals on a schedule, with no manual poke. Off by default (it commits recurring AI spend), owner-gated, and bounded: a per-tick cap of 5 workspaces, oldest-run-first. The scheduler that drives it is a founder activation step (see Governance below).

## Why it exists

Pain #1 (v10): "signal is scattered; I miss things and react late." A live, per-product feed means the operator sees their product's fresh signal without hunting or manual refreshes.

## Where to find it

`/product` > the **Signals** tab. Switch products with the portfolio switcher; the feed follows the active product.

## How it works

- **No migration.** `signals` and `themes` already carry `project_id` (and `workspace_id`); F3 just started using `project_id` for the feed.
- `listSignals` / `listThemes` / `clusterSignals` / `bulkImportSignals` (in `src/lib/discovery.functions.ts`) take an optional product id. When set, reads filter on `project_id`, clustering scopes to that product's unclustered signals, and new themes are stamped with it. `createSignal` already accepted `project_id`. When absent, every query is unscoped, so the change is fully back-compatible.
- `SignalsPanel.tsx` reads the active product from `useWorkspace()` (`activeProductId`), passes it to all of the above, and includes it in the React Query keys so switching products refetches the scoped feed. `SignalDetail` and the onboarding themes read stay deliberately unscoped (a single signal's detail needs the full set; onboarding is pre-product).
- **Nothing is hidden.** Unassigned signals (no product, for example the workspace ingest webhook) live in the all-products view; they are not filed under a product, not lost. A signal whose theme was clustered under a different scope is shown as a standalone row rather than vanishing.
- **Auto-cluster cron.** The shared core `clusterSignalsCore` (`src/lib/ai/cluster.server.ts`) is called by both the user-triggered `clusterSignals` server fn and the `cluster-tick` hook (`src/routes/api/public/hooks/cluster-tick.ts`). The core explicitly filters `signals.user_id`, so the service-role cron path (RLS off) clusters one owner at a time, never across users; it passes `workspaceId` so the kill-switch and budget caps still apply, and stamps `themes.workspace_id` explicitly because the cron has no `auth.uid()` for the DB default. The `getWorkspaceClusterSettings` / `toggleAutoCluster` server fns (owner-gated) back the toggle. Migration `20260618140000_f3_auto_cluster.sql` adds `workspaces.auto_cluster_enabled` (NOT NULL DEFAULT false) and `last_auto_cluster_at`, plus a partial index for the cron query; it is additive and idempotent and commits zero spend on apply.

## Governance & guardrails

- Read scoping is an additive filter, never a security boundary: RLS still scopes every read to the caller by `user_id`. `project_id` only narrows within the user's own rows.
- Calm-front: the feed names the outcome (the product's signals), not the mechanism.
- **Recurring spend stays founder-gated.** The migration deliberately ships NO scheduler, so applying it commits zero AI spend. To turn continuous SENSE on (a founder step): owners opt their workspace in via the toggle, then point a scheduler (for example Supabase `pg_cron` + `pg_net`) at `POST /api/public/hooks/cluster-tick` with the apikey header. The exact `cron.schedule` snippet and the manual publish-verify are in the migration header and below.

## Verification checklist

- [x] `tsc --noEmit` clean, `eslint` clean, `bun run build` green, my additions humanization-clean (2026-06-18 12:20).
- [x] Auto-cluster cron closed 2026-06-18: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `eslint` clean on all four touched files, `bun run build` green (the `cluster-tick` route bundles), F3 source + migration scan zero em/en dashes. Cross-user safety verified by code read (`clusterSignalsCore` filters `user_id`; cron stamps `themes.workspace_id`); pre-migration tolerance handled (`42703`/`PGRST204` soft-pass).
- [x] Adversarial review folded: a signal whose theme is outside the current scope is shown standalone (never vanishes); back-compat preserved (no product active = unscoped, identical to before); `project_id` filter is parameterized + uuid-validated.
- [ ] **Pending published-app verification (needs the founder to publish first):** with two products, capture a signal under product A, switch to product B and confirm it does not appear; switch back to A and confirm it does; cluster under A and confirm the theme shows only under A; confirm the all-products view shows everything including webhook signals.

## Known limits / out of scope

- **Auto-cluster cron is built but dormant until the founder schedules it.** The opt-in flag, the owner toggle, the spend-governed `cluster-tick` hook, and the migration all shipped 2026-06-18; the recurring-spend scheduler (pg_cron) is the one remaining founder activation step, by design. The manual "Cluster N" action is per-product and always available.
- F3 scopes the **signals + themes** feed. Per-product scoping of opportunities/specs is separate, future work.
- Assigning an existing unassigned (webhook) signal to a product from the UI is a fast-follow; today new captures are filed under the active product at capture time.
