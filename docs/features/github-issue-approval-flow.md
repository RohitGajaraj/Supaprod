> Operator-facing reference for the `github.issue.create` → `prd.link_issue` slice. This is the exit ramp where the Discover → Define → Plan loop leaves Supaprod and lands as a real GitHub issue against the engineering system of record, under an explicit human approval gate.

## 1. Purpose: why this exists

Claim C3 ("one governed loop") only becomes literally true once a mission can exit Supaprod into the engineering system of record **without** the operator hand-copying a draft PRD into GitHub. The `github.issue.create` tool is that exit; the `prd.link_issue` follow-up writes the resulting issue URL back onto the PRD so the loop is visible end-to-end from `/prds/$id`.

The tool is **`confirm`-gated by default** (not `auto`). It performs a real, billable, side-effecting write to a third-party system, so it stops at the Decision Queue every time the Planner reaches the Plan step. Nothing reaches GitHub until a human clicks **Approve**.

## 2. What happens when you click Approve

1. **Planner proposes the call.** The agent loop (`src/lib/ai/loop.server.ts`) emits a `tool_call` step with `name='github.issue.create'` and structured args (`title`, `body`, `labels`, `idempotency_key`, typically the PRD id). Because the tool's effective mode is `confirm`, the loop inserts an `agent_approvals` row and **suspends the run** instead of executing.
2. **Decision Queue surfaces it.** The pending approval shows up in the Decision Queue on `/agents` and on the live `/missions/$missionId` Mission Graph as a node in the `awaiting_approval` state.
3. **You Approve (or Reject).** `decideApproval` in `src/lib/agent_loop.functions.ts` marks the row `approved` and calls `executeApproval`, which dispatches to the tool handler in `src/lib/ai/tools/registry.server.ts`.
4. **Real POST to GitHub.** The handler reads `GITHUB_REPO` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` from `process.env`, validates `GITHUB_REPO` matches `owner/name`, and calls:
   ```
   POST https://api.github.com/repos/${GITHUB_REPO}/issues
   Authorization: Bearer ${GITHUB_TOKEN}
   Body: { title, body, labels }
   ```
5. **Idempotency.** The whole call is wrapped in `withIdempotency('github_issue', args.idempotency_key, …)` (see [`../src/lib/runtime/idempotency.server.ts`](../src/lib/runtime/idempotency.server.ts)). If the same `idempotency_key` was already executed, by a worker restart, by the resume-runs sweeper picking up a stalled run, or by a manual re-approval, the cached `{ number, url, id, repo, cached: true }` is returned and **no second issue is created**.
6. **PRD link-back.** The Planner's next step calls `prd.link_issue(prd_id, issue_url)`, which sets `prds.github_issue_url`. This step is also `confirm`-gated; approve it the same way.
7. **UI reflects it.** `/prds/$id` now renders a `Github · GitHub issue #N` chip immediately below the back-link, parsed from the URL. The Mission Graph node flips to `executed`.

## 3. Which repo. Which token. Always the same one.

- **Single repo.** The tool is allow-listed to whatever is configured in the `GITHUB_REPO` runtime secret (format `owner/name`, e.g. `RohitGajaraj/Test-Project-Cadence`). The agent **cannot** pick a different repo per call. The value is read from env at call time, not from tool args.
- **Single token.** `GITHUB_TOKEN` is a fine-grained Personal Access Token, scoped to that one repo, with **Issues: Read & Write**. No `admin`, no `repo` (full), no org scopes. The minimum permission to do the job.
- **Secrets are runtime-only.** Both values live in the Lovable Cloud secret store and are only ever read inside the server-side tool handler (`process.env` inside `.handler()`). They are never bundled into the client, never logged, and never surfaced in tool args.

To point Supaprod at a different repo: rotate `GITHUB_REPO` (and `GITHUB_TOKEN` if the new repo needs a different PAT) via the Lovable Cloud secrets UI. No code change, no redeploy. The next call picks up the new values.

## 4. Failure modes (and how each surfaces)

| Failure | Where it surfaces | Operator action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GITHUB_REPO` missing or malformed (not `owner/name`) | Approval `executed=false`, `error` on the `agent_approvals` row, red node in Mission Graph | Fix the secret, re-dispatch the mission |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` missing | Same as above | Set the secret |
| GitHub `401 Unauthorized` | `error` on the approval row contains the GitHub message | PAT expired or wrong scope, rotate |
| GitHub `403 Forbidden` | Same | PAT is valid but lacks Issues:Write on this repo |
| GitHub `404` | Same | `GITHUB_REPO` points at a repo the token can't see |
| GitHub `422` (validation) | Same | Title empty or label doesn't exist on the repo |
| Rate limit (`403` with `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0`) | Same | Wait, then re-approve. Idempotency key protects you |
| Network / timeout | Approval marked `failed`; the loop will not retry automatically | Re-approve; cached result wins if the issue actually went through |

Every outcome is logged to `tool_calls` (joined to the run's `traceId`) with latency, args, and result/error, visible on `/traces/$traceId` and on the Mission Graph node detail.

## 5. How to use / verify

**Where to find it:**

- Sidebar → **Agents** (`/agents`): dispatch missions and see the Decision Queue.
- Sidebar → **Missions** (`/missions`) → open one → Mission Graph + per-hop progress panel.
- Sidebar → **PRDs** (`/prds`) → open the PRD → the `GitHub issue #N` chip appears once linked.

**Step-by-step verification:**

1. On `/agents` pick the **Orchestrator**, tick **Start as mission**, and dispatch:
   > _"Take the highest-ICE backlog opportunity, draft a PRD, and open a GitHub issue for engineering. Use idempotency_key = the PRD id."_
2. Toast routes you to `/missions/{id}`. The Mission Graph fills in within ~2s: Discovery → Strategist → Planner hops appear as nodes with labelled handoff edges.
3. When the Planner reaches the Plan step, a `github.issue.create` approval card appears on `/agents`. The Mission Graph node is in `awaiting_approval`.
4. Click **Approve**. Within a few seconds:
   - A new issue exists on `https://github.com/${GITHUB_REPO}/issues`.
   - The `github.issue.create` node flips to `executed`; tooltip shows `{ number, url, cached: false }`.
   - The Planner emits `prd.link_issue`. Approve that too.
5. Open `/prds/$id` for the linked PRD: a `GitHub issue #N` chip is now under the back-link, linking out to the real issue.
6. **Idempotency check:** re-trigger the same approval (or let the resume-runs sweeper retry a stalled run). Result should come back with `cached: true` and **no** second issue is created.

**Where to look when something feels wrong:**

- `/traces/$traceId` (one click from the Mission Graph node): full per-step thought + tool_call + result trail.
- `tool_calls` rows joined by trace id: raw latency + args + result/error.
- `agent_approvals` row for the specific approval: `status`, `decided_by`, `decided_at`, `error`.

## 6. How to rotate the GitHub secrets

1. Mint a new fine-grained PAT on GitHub scoped to the target repo only, with **Issues: Read & Write**.
2. In Lovable, open the Cloud secrets UI and update `GITHUB_TOKEN` (and `GITHUB_REPO` if pointing at a new repo, format `owner/name`).
3. The next `github.issue.create` approval picks up the new values automatically. No code change, no redeploy.

If the rotation was emergency (suspected leak), also revoke the old PAT in the GitHub settings UI so it can't be used.

## 7. What is _not_ in this slice (deferred to Bundle 9 and later)

- `github.pr.open` (Bundle 9): opening pull requests against the same repo, same approval pattern.
- CI status read into the Mission Graph (Bundle 9).
- `github.issue.update` / `github.issue.close`: currently the operator closes issues in GitHub directly.
- Cross-repo selection: `GITHUB_REPO` is intentionally a single allow-listed value; multi-repo support is a future explicit decision, not a default.
