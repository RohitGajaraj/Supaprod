# Task graph (H1: PRD → engineering plan)

## What it does

The Planner step of the golden path: it decomposes an approved spec (PRD) into a **dependency-ordered engineering task graph**: 4 to 12 concrete build tasks, each with a 1-line detail, an hour estimate, an owner (agent for code/test/infra, you for decisions/design), a risk flag, and `depends_on` edges. The tasks link to the PRD, so they populate the PRD's "linked tasks" and flow on to Build / Linear.

## Why it exists

Completes the M1 demo path: signals → opportunity → spec → **task graph** → Builder PR + CI. Spec H1 in [`../strategy/archive/v4-feature-map.md`](../strategy/archive/v4-feature-map.md); build-log [`../../plan.md`](../planning/archive/build-log.md) §4 (2026-06-14 · H1).

## Where to find it

`/prds/$id` → the **Task graph** card → **Generate task graph**. The button decomposes the spec and renders the tasks dependency-ordered (`#seq · title — detail · Nh · owner · after #n · risk`).

## How it works

- **`generateTaskGraph(prd_id)`** (`src/lib/discovery.functions.ts`): reuses the `generatePrd` `callModel` infra (Gemini 2.5 Pro, `responseFormat:"json_object"`). Output is capped/clamped; `depends_on` may only reference lower `seq` numbers (a valid DAG). Honesty-guarded: "only tasks the spec implies, do not invent scope."
- **Storage**: writes to `tasks` (linked by `prd_id`). Migration `20260614190000` adds `tasks.{seq, depends_on, risk, detail}`. `estimate_hours`/`assignee_kind`/`agent_id`/`prd_id` already existed.
- **Idempotent**: re-generating deletes the prior generated graph (`seq IS NOT NULL`) and re-inserts; **manually-added tasks (`seq` NULL) are never touched**. Pre-migration-tolerant: if the graph columns aren't applied yet it falls back to a flat task insert (the toast says so).

## Governance & guardrails

- Owner-scoped: the read, the delete-then-insert, and the render all run through the authenticated client + the `tasks` "own tasks" RLS, only the caller's own PRD/tasks.
- The generated tasks reuse the existing `tasks` lifecycle (status, Linear push, Build dispatch); no new execution path, the mission orchestrator already runs DAGs.

## Verification checklist

- After sync: open an approved spec → **Generate task graph** → 4 to 12 tasks render dependency-ordered with estimates/owners/deps/risk; the metadata row's "linked tasks" count updates; **Push to Linear** / **Send to Build** still work.
- Re-generate → the graph replaces (count stays sane); any manually-added task survives.
- Before sync: the button still creates tasks (flat); the toast notes graph fields apply after sync.

## Consumption — the read side (H1-TASKS, shipped 2026-06-21, ◐)

Generation wrote the DAG; this makes it READABLE. The stored `seq` + `depends_on` are now turned back into a usable graph on the PRD detail surface:

- **Pure core** `src/lib/task-graph.ts` (zero db/AI, 13 tests): `sanitizeDependsOn` (a stricter superset of the write-side guard), `validateTaskGraph` (cycle / missing-dep / self-dep / forward-ref integrity, DFS-based, so it stays honest even if the data is malformed), `topoOrder` (Kahn's, stable by seq, TOTAL on a cycle so nothing is ever dropped), `readyTasks` (not-done with every dependency done; a missing dep keeps a task blocked), `summarizeTaskGraph` (the done/ready/blocked readiness partition + remaining-effort estimate + percent-complete).
- **Read fn** `getTaskGraph(prdId)` (`src/lib/task-graph.functions.ts`): RLS-scoped (mirrors `listTasks`), reads generated tasks (`seq NOT NULL`), returns `{ nodes: topo-ordered, summary, issues }`.
- **Surface** `src/components/product/TaskGraphPanel.tsx` on `/prds/$id`: a calm "Build readiness" line (N of M done · ready · blocked · ~Xh left), the ready-now seqs, and any DAG integrity issues (in `--rose`, the failure-role color). Silent until a graph exists; refetches when the graph is regenerated.
- **Verification:** a 2-lens adversarial-review Workflow (topology/RLS · reuse/wiring/honesty) returned 0 blockers, SHIP_WITH_FIXES; folded a stale-panel cache-invalidation defect + a role-color fix + the self-dep double-report. tsc 0 / eslint 0 / 551 tests.
- **Deferred (lane boundary):** the task-graph → mission-steps bridge (auto-plan a Build mission from the DAG) needs `studio.functions.ts` (Build lane); follow-up.
