# Parallel Development Model — Document-Driven, No Code Silos

> _Created: 2026-06-03 · Last updated: 2026-06-19_

> **How this repo is co-developed across Claude Code, Lovable, Antigravity, and Gemini without coordination overhead.** The model: files are shared, documentation is the boundary. Canonical rules: [`../../AGENTS.md`](../archive/agent-operating-manual.md). This document is the detailed reference; AGENTS.md §10 is the summary pointer.

**Related:** for the concrete numbered-lane worktree mechanism that implements this, see [`operations/parallel-build.md`](../operations/parallel-build.md).

## Core principle: No code ownership

There are no "Claude Code files" or "Lovable files." Every tool can touch every file. The status board and the SSOT section 0 (the live cursor, [`../planning/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`](../planning/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md)) coordinate who is working on what — not file ownership rules.

**Why this works:** Documentation is the coordination mechanism. When every tool documents what it did, why, and what comes next — handoffs are seamless, conflicts are rare, and context is never lost.

---

## The three rules

**Rule 1: Whoever touches a file owns that task.**
Temporary ownership. When you start working on a task, you own it until you hand it off via the SSOT section 0 (the live cursor) and the status board. The next tool picks it up from there.

**Rule 2: Always check before you start.**
Before touching any file, check the status board (`docs/planning/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md` top section). If another tool is already working on that task: stop, pick a different task. If no tool is working on it: claim it by setting "Now building" in the status board.

**Rule 3: Leave the codebase in a known state.**
When you end a session, the next tool must be able to continue without asking you questions. That means:

- The SSOT section 0 (the live cursor) tells them exactly where you stopped
- The status board tells them the current state
- Your commits tell them what changed and why

## The handoff mechanism (replaces code ownership)

| Artifact | Purpose | Updated when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SSOT section 0 (the live cursor, `docs/planning/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`) | Exact checklist of in-flight sub-steps | Start of task, each sub-step, end of session |
| status board (`docs/planning/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md` top) | "Now building," "Next up," "Blocked," recent log | Start and end of every session |
| Git commits | What changed, why it changed (one-line WHY) | Every logical chunk of work |
| `docs/strategy/session-decisions.md` | Major strategic decisions from sessions | When a strategic decision is made |
| `docs/planning/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md` | Feature state (✅/◐/⬜) | When feature is started or completed |
| Architecture docs (`architecture/`) | How the system works | When architecture changes |
| `docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md` | Design tokens, component contracts | When UI patterns change |

## Session workflow for every tool

### Session start

1. `git pull origin main` — get latest from all other tools
2. Read the SSOT section 0 (the live cursor) in [`../planning/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`](../planning/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md) — this is your exact handoff
3. Read status board (`docs/planning/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md` top) — check "Now building"
4. Read latest positioning in `docs/strategy/` — know what you're building and why
5. Set "Now building" in status board with your task ID

### During work

- Commit every 5–15 minutes with a clear WHY message
- Push immediately after every commit (so other tools see your work)
- Update the SSOT section 0 (the live cursor) checkboxes as you complete sub-steps
- If you change design tokens: update `docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md` in the same commit
- If you change routing/architecture: update the relevant `architecture/*.md`

### Session end

- Push all uncommitted work
- Update status board: feature done (☑) or paused (with "Now building" set)
- Update the SSOT section 0 (the live cursor): exact state for the next tool
- Add to `docs/strategy/session-decisions.md` if you made a strategic decision
- Commit and push the status updates

## What each tool owns (and doesn't exclusively own)

### Every tool owns:

- The SSOT section 0 (the live cursor) — keep it true
- status board — update it
- Code quality — write clean, tested, documented code
- Doc sync — keep relevant docs in sync with code changes
- Handoff documentation — leave full context for the next tool

### No tool exclusively owns:

- Any file in `src/`
- Any file in `supabase/`
- Any doc in `architecture/`
- Any layer of the stack

The only "ownership" that exists is the temporary ownership of the current task — held until the handoff is complete.

## Conflict avoidance

Most conflicts are prevented by:

1. Checking the status board before starting
2. Pushing frequently (so others see your work quickly)
3. Small, focused commits (reduces merge surface)

When conflicts do happen:

1. The first tool to commit and push wins
2. The second tool pulls, gets a merge conflict, resolves it, pushes again
3. Both tools note this in the status board if it was tricky
4. No one force-pushes to resolve conflicts

## Cross-references

This model is summarized in:

- [`../../AGENTS.md`](../archive/agent-operating-manual.md) §10 (summary pointer)
- [`../../CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) (Claude Code behavioral guidelines)
- [`../../GEMINI.md`](../archive/gemini-brief.md) (Antigravity/Gemini guidelines)
- [`../../.lovable-config.txt`](../../.lovable-config.txt) Section 5 (Lovable Knowledge)

The status board lives in: [`../planning/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`](../planning/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md)
