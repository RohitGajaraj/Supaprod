# tools.md — Tool conventions

> _Created: 2026-06-03 · Last updated: 2026-06-19_

> When to use which tool. Keeps tool calls cheap, correct, and reviewable. Operating rules: [`AGENTS.md`](../archive/agent-operating-manual.md). This file was referenced across the docs but missing — it now exists.

## File and search tools (use the dedicated tool, not Bash)

| Need | Tool | Not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Find files by name/pattern | `Glob` | `find`, `ls` |
| Search file contents | `Grep` | `grep`, `rg` in Bash |
| Read a known file | `Read` | `cat`, `head`, `tail` |
| Edit an existing file | `Edit` | `sed`, `awk` |
| Create / fully rewrite a file | `Write` | `echo >`, heredoc |
| Open-ended multi-round search | `Agent` (Explore) | repeated manual greps |

Reserve `Bash` for actually running things (installs, builds, tests, migrations, git). Quote paths with spaces.

## Lovable is the first checkpoint: query it directly, never guess

Supaprod was built on, is hosted on, and is published through **Lovable**, the live system of record for the whole project (Supabase database, auth and OAuth, connectors, edge functions, hosting, deploys, analytics, logs, source). When you hit any gap, error, or unknown (a backend or infra fact, a credential, a data point, a deployment status, an error or log, an analytics number, a SQL result, a project or file detail), check Lovable directly first via the connected **Lovable MCP** (`mcp__lovable__*`, declared in `.mcp.json`); use the **Supabase MCP** (`mcp__supabase__*`) for SQL (`execute_sql`), logs (`get_logs`), and advisors (`get_advisors`). Do not assume, infer, or fabricate it. One exception, secrets and env are local-first: certain key secrets live in this project's git-ignored `.env` and as wrangler secrets, so check local first for those. Otherwise fall back to local files only when the MCP genuinely cannot answer, and say so. Canonical rule: the Lovable callout in [`AGENTS.md`](../archive/agent-operating-manual.md) §0.

## Read/Edit/Write discipline

- **Read before Edit/Write on existing files.** The tools track read-state by absolute path. After any `mv`/`git mv`, re-Read at the new path (see [`AGENTS.md`](../archive/agent-operating-manual.md), section 7).
- **Prefer `Edit` over `Write` for changes** — it sends only the diff. Use `Write` for new files or full rewrites.
- **Surgical edits only.** Every changed line traces to the task ([`AGENTS.md`](../archive/agent-operating-manual.md), section 3).

## Bash discipline

- Batch independent commands into one message with parallel calls; chain dependent ones with `&&`.
- Use `run_in_background` for long-running processes; do not poll with `sleep`.
- Package managers: `npm`/`bun` as the repo uses; for Python use the repo's environment convention.
- Never run destructive git (`reset --hard`, `push --force`, branch delete) without explicit approval. See [`commits.md`](./commits.md).

## Tasks

- Create tasks for any multi-step work; set `in_progress` when starting, `completed` when done.
- Do not batch-complete at the end — update as you go ([`AGENTS.md`](../archive/agent-operating-manual.md), section 1).
- Include a verification step for non-trivial work (tests, screenshots, diff review).

## Subagents (Agent/Task tool)

- Selection and briefing guidance: [`subagents.md`](./subagents.md).
- Launch independent subagents in a single message to run them concurrently.
- Verify a code-writing subagent's diff before reporting done.

## Web and docs

- For library docs, prefer the `context7-plugin` over raw web fetch.
- For current facts, search before answering — do not rely on training for present-day state.

## Product / runtime tools (inside the app)

Tool calls _the product's agents_ make (e.g. `search_workspace`, `create_task`, `create_linear_issue`, `write_doc`, `run_eval`, `delegate_to_agent`) are a product capability with their own allow-list and audit log. Their contract lives in [`architecture/runtime.md`](../../architecture/runtime.md) and [`architecture/integrations.md`](../../architecture/integrations.md) — not here.
