## Two kinds of "agent" — do not confuse them

| Kind | What it is | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Product agents** | The in-product specialists Supaprod runs for the user — 6 outcome-focused durable agents (Orchestrator, Discovery, Strategist, Builder, Growth, Analyst) plus ephemeral specialists spawned by Orchestrator per task. Each agent owns a clear lifecycle band; fixed seats for micro-roles are avoided. Full roster with persona mapping: plan.md §6. | Seeded in the `agents` table. Configured via `system_prompt`, `tool_allowlist`, `default_model`, `temperature`, `approval_mode`, `memory_enabled`. Full roster and rationale: [`planning/archive/build-log.md`](../planning/archive/build-log.md) §6. |
| **Engineering subagents** | The ones you delegate to via the `Agent`/Task tool. | Provided by the harness + plugins. Active list appears in the session reminder. |

This doc is meta-guidance for **engineering agents & subagents**. Product agents are a product capability — schema changes need a migration and a [`planning/archive/build-log.md`](../planning/archive/build-log.md) update.

## When to delegate

- **Parallelizable independent work** — multiple file searches, multiple reviewers across surfaces.
- **Large intermediate output** you do not want polluting main context — broad codebase exploration.
- **A specialized agent's description fits** — match its purpose, do not force-fit.

If a task is single-step and you know the target, use the direct tool. Do not delegate routine reads, greps, or edits.

## Default picks for this repo

| Goal | Subagent |
| --- | --- |
| Open-ended code search across many files | `Explore` |
| Implementation plan for a non-trivial feature | `Plan` or `ecc:planner` |
| Architectural design | `ecc:architect` / `ecc:code-architect` |
| Trace how a feature works end-to-end | `ecc:code-explorer` |
| Library docs lookup | `ecc:docs-lookup` / `context7-plugin:docs-researcher` |
| TS/JS review post-change | `ecc:typescript-reviewer` |
| React/Tailwind UI review | `ecc:typescript-reviewer` + `ecc:a11y-architect` |
| DB / migration / RLS review | `ecc:database-reviewer` |
| Security review (auth, BYO keys, hooks) | `ecc:security-reviewer` |
| Test coverage for a PR | `ecc:pr-test-analyzer` |
| Silent-failure / swallowed-error hunt | `ecc:silent-failure-hunter` |
| Documentation pass | `ecc:doc-updater` |
| E2E test creation / repair | `ecc:e2e-runner` |
| Build / type error fix | `ecc:build-error-resolver` |

The above suggested agent's list is for a short use case, for example, and the preferences are just an example. You have a vast, huge amount of skills and agents available for your disposal. Please always look into the library that's installed and available to you, and also look into the respective folders. What skills make sense? Please invoke them accordingly and plan for it accordingly. You are free to invoke everything. I want you to first prefer skills and agents first rather than you trying to do the task on your own first.

## How to brief a subagent

Brief it like a smart colleague who just walked in with zero context.

- State the goal in one sentence.
- Give enough background that it can make judgment calls.
- Specify what to check and what form the answer should take.
- Terse one-line prompts produce shallow output. Be specific.

## Trust but verify

A subagent's summary describes what it _intended_ to do. For any code-writing agent, read the diff before declaring done.

## Anti-patterns

- Invoking five reviewers for a 20-line change. Pick one.
- Running multiple planners for the same feature. Pick one.
- Delegating routine reads or one-line greps. Just do them.
- Repeating a search a subagent is already running. Wait for its result.

## ⚠️ Long fan-outs: land each agent's output as it finishes, never at the end

> **Founder ruling, 2026-08-14:** _"After each subagent's work is done, save it somewhere so that even if the system shuts down you can retrieve it. I don't want you to begin from the start."_

**The gap this closes.** A `Workflow` returns its result **only when the whole script finishes**. A twenty-agent run that dies on agent nineteen hands you nothing, and if each agent did expensive work — live page checks, screenshots, audits — that is hours gone.

**The work is not actually lost, and knowing where it is matters more than the fix.** The harness appends one line per finished agent to `journal.jsonl` in the run's transcript directory:

```json
{"type":"result","agentId":"a40be...","result":{ ... }}
```

That directory lives under `~/.claude/projects/`, so it **survives a reboot**. But raw JSONL in a session directory is not retrievable in any practical sense, and nobody will find it under pressure.

**The pattern.** Poll the journal on a timer, materialise each result to disk, commit.

1. **Take the transcript dir from the launch result.** It is printed when the workflow starts.
2. **Write one untouched file per agent first** — never merged, never overwritten by a peer. That is the recovery point when a roll-up turns out to be wrong.
3. **Build the readable roll-up from those**, then commit.
4. **Make the harvester idempotent** — rebuild every output from the journal on each pass. Then the harvester is disposable: if it dies, re-run it and the state returns. **The journal is the source of truth; the harvested files never are.**

**Two things that cost time to learn:**

- **Do not pass `--no-verify` to stop the hooks firing on a 30-second commit loop.** It trades the repo's invariants for a convenience the durability requirement does not need. A failed gate should fail the commit — the files are already on disk either way, and the failure belongs in the log where someone sees it.
- **The harvested folder is temporary and must be deleted when the run completes.** Leaving it beside the canonical output is how a second, staler copy of the same data gets created, which the pitch folder's standing rules forbid outright.

**Cross-session relay is unreliable.** `SendMessage` to a peer session failed three times while passing this ruling between lanes, twice with the confirmed `[ref]`. **A rule that has to reach another lane goes in a tracked file, not a message.**
