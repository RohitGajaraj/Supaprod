# Competitive reference (deferred — for inspiration, not a scorecard)

> _Created: 2026-06-03 · Last updated: 2026-06-11_

> Status: **DEFERRED / REFERENCE ONLY.** Moved out of [`planning/archive/build-log.md`](../planning/archive/build-log.md) at the founder's request — plan.md absorbs the _inspiration_ into Cadence's own features; this file keeps the raw study for later reading. Not a maintained competitive analysis. Date: 2026-05-29.

## Why this exists

We studied a few products to learn what good looks like and where the open ground is. The takeaways are baked into the feature catalog in [`planning/archive/build-log.md`](../planning/archive/build-log.md) (section 2). This page just retains the underlying notes.

## The pattern

Each reference product owns one band of the lifecycle. **Nobody owns the whole loop (discover → define → plan → build → test → ship → launch → support → learn) as one governed autonomous system.** That whitespace is Cadence's position and moat ([`../../README.md`](../../README.md)).

## What we took (now in plan.md features)

- **From factory.ai:** autonomous build/ship + a live mission view — extended _past code_ into launch and support.
- **From hyperagent:** a team of agents with per-agent budgets + self-improving memory.
- **From Linear:** agents as first-class, assignable, @mentionable; saved-workflow skills; event-triggered automations.
- **Our win:** the band none own — the governed end-to-end loop with multi-product orchestration.

## Other autonomous-agent platforms (context)

Devin/Cognition (autonomous SWE in a cloud env, parallel runs); Replit Agent (plan/write/test/deploy apps, can build other agents); OpenAI Codex (terminal-native agentic coding); Cursor (AI-native IDE, interactive); Gemini CLI (free frontier, 1M context). All own _engineering_; none own the full product lifecycle.
