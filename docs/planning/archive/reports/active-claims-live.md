# Build status - LIVE (auto-generated; do not edit)

> _Created: 2026-06-21 · Last updated: 2026-06-21_

> **The real-time view of who is building what + what is next.** Regenerated every few seconds by the `com.cadence.active-claims-sync` watcher from the atomic claim ledger (`~/.cadence-parallel`, instant) and origin/main's register (read-only `git fetch`, no pull needed). **Git-ignored** - it never rots, never conflicts. Instant CLI view: `bash scripts/lane.sh board`.

>
> **COLLISIONS ARE PREVENTED BY THE LEDGER, NOT THIS FILE.** Before any work, a session MUST run `bash scripts/lane.sh claim <ID> <lane> "<globs>"` and proceed only if it returns success (exit 0 = won). A `HELD`/`CONFLICT` result means another lane has it - pick the next 🟢 free item below. Never start work before claiming.

## Top of the rank - LIVE status (✓ done · 🔒 building · 🟢 free)

> **Status meaning:** ⬜ open · 🔨 building now · ◐ built + gates green, **pending your publish-verify** · ✅ verified live. A lane marks **◐ when it finishes building** (honest status), and only flips to ✅ after you publish and it is behaviorally verified - so a `◐` here means the lane HAS finished it, not that it is unfinished.

## Standing reservations (safety, not a lane task)

- `CHOKEPOINT` (lane `core`) - AI chokepoint/agent core - no lane touches this
