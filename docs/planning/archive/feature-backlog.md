# docs/feature-backlog.md — The granular feature backlog (build-ready)

> _Created: 2026-06-03 · Last updated: 2026-06-19_

> [!WARNING]
> **⚠ SUPERSEDED (2026-06-23). Do NOT add new items here; do NOT treat its ☐ markers as live status.** The single build register is now [`feature-dashboard.md`](./feature-dashboard.md) (the ranked rows + the v11 build front #1-21, each with a Why). Its ☐ markers below are STALE: most are already-shipped work the dashboard tracks correctly (the agent roster, A2A handoff, product memory, ship bundle, etc.). Per-feature acceptance detail now lives in the relevant [`../features/`](../features/) docs. The one genuinely-pending item not previously on the board, **DEF-04 (designer scaffolds)**, was salvaged into the dashboard on 2026-06-23. This file is retained only for historical F-ID references; its physical archive + a broader repo-structure declutter (it has ~25 live inbound links, so the move needs a same-commit link-update pass) is tracked as **`REPO-DECLUTTER-V11`** in the dashboard.

> **SSOT first.** The single front-door tracker is [`SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`](./SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md) (status, build queue, founder rulings, findings, progress). This file is the granular acceptance-criteria and scope ledger (the F-ID detail) it points to, not the tracker to follow day-to-day.

> **What this is.** The exhaustive, sub-feature-level enumeration of _everything Supaprod is built to ship_ — the dev-ready expansion of [`../plan.md`](../../plan.md) §2 (granular catalog). Every feature has a **stable ID** (e.g. `F2.3`) so it can become an issue/PR/spec and be referenced by traces, decisions, and the build log without re-describing scope.
>
> **Relationship to other docs (no duplication of rules).** Product thesis + USP/MOAT: [`../README.md`](../README.md). Build _order_: [`../plan.md`](../../plan.md) §3. Cross-cutting non-functional rationale + P0/P1/P2 priorities: [`../docs/considerations.md`](./considerations.md). UI/IA/screen + AI-message contract: [`../design.md`](../../DESIGN.md). Architecture contracts: [`../architecture/`](../../architecture/). Operating rules: [`../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md).
>
> **This file adds detail; it does not replace `docs/planning/archive/build-log.md`.** `docs/planning/archive/build-log.md` stays the narrative + build order; this is the flat, addressable scope list. Keep both true (closed doc loop, [`../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) §5).
>
> **Looking for the next task to pick up?** Jump to the [Build-order rollup](#build-order-rollup-status--build-sequence) at the bottom - it is the canonical task queue. The live cursor (now / next / blocked) and the day-to-day build queue live in the SSOT, [`SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`](./SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md) (section 0 + section 3), which points back here for F-ID scope.

---

## ▶ Live status (moved) - this file is the F-ID scope ledger

> **The live status board moved.** Where-are-we-now (now building / next up / blocked) and the day-to-day build queue live in the SSOT, [`SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`](./SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md) - section 0 (the live cursor) + section 3. The per-station status matrix lives in [`feature-dashboard.md`](./feature-dashboard.md). The full append-only build history is [`../plan.md`](../../plan.md) section 4.
>
> **This file** holds only the granular, per-F-ID scope + acceptance criteria (the pillar catalog and the [Build-order rollup](#build-order-rollup-status--build-sequence) below). Read the SSOT first for what to pick up; come here for the detail behind a given F-ID.

## ▶ v4 Feature Map overlay (2026-06-11) — the binding scope layer

> **The v4 feature map ([`../strategy/archive/v4-feature-map.md`](../strategy/archive/v4-feature-map.md)) is now the binding scope source.** This overlay maps its station catalogs onto this backlog. The 8-Pillar grouping below remains as historical organization for existing F-IDs; new work is filed under v4 IDs. Where a v4 ID and a legacy F-ID cover the same thing, the row notes it — do not double-build.

**New v4 feature IDs (station · ID · status · maps-to-legacy):**

## ▶ Agentic Proof Platform (v1.1) — full product lifecycle, end-to-end on real systems

> **What this is.** A scope overlay — not a new roadmap. The exhaustive backlog below is unchanged. This section picks the smallest subset of existing features whose _combined, end-to-end behavior on real data_ proves that Supaprod delivers agentic-native product management that legacy PM tools (Jira, Linear, Productboard, ProductPlan, Aha) structurally cannot. **The YC demo is a by-product; the platform is the point.**
>
> **Locked decisions (2026-06-03):** Demo persona = **Founder-as-PM** ("run the product org you can't afford to hire"). Demo data = **real product** (default: Supaprod-on-Supaprod; design partner is additive). **v1.1 un-defers Build/Test/Ship/Launch/Support** to cover the whole PM lifecycle end-to-end — under one realism rule: _agents orchestrate existing tools (GitHub, CI, deploy, Slack/email, support channel) where the tool already exists; they don't replace IDEs, CI, or helpdesks._ See [`docs/strategy/session-decisions.md`](../strategy/session-decisions.md) for the reframe.
>
> **From demo cut → proof cut.** Every bundle now ships against an explicit **proof bar** — the minimum behavior that makes the claim true on real data, not just visible in a screenshot. If a visitor cannot point to each of the four claims being true in the running product within ~5 minutes, the bundle hasn't shipped.

### The four claims we are proving

| #      | Claim (vs. legacy PM tools)                                                                                                                  | Proof artifact                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C1** | Agents **operate**, humans govern — agents run multi-step missions, not assist with forms                                                    | Live Mission Graph + Decision Queue with real approval gates firing                                                                                                  |
| **C2** | **Agent-to-agent handoff is first-class** — no human in the routing path                                                                     | A2A trace: Discovery → Strategist → Planner, each reading prior agent's structured output, with full lineage                                                         |
| **C3** | The **whole lifecycle is one governed loop** — Discover → Define → Plan → Build → Test → Ship → Launch → Support → Learn (re-feeds Discover) | One continuous mission from a real signal to a re-scored opportunity, passing through a real PR, real merge, real deploy, real outbound message, real inbound ticket |
| **C4** | **Trust is earned and visible** — autonomy is dialed, not assumed                                                                            | Trust Score + Autonomy Dial per agent, changing behavior of approval gates in real time                                                                              |

### Realism rule (so "full lifecycle" doesn't become "half-baked everywhere")

For each lifecycle stage, the demo bar is: a real artifact lands in a real external system that a PM would actually use, driven by an agent through a real integration. No mocks. No "click here and pretend it deployed."

| Stage    | Real external system                                            | Real artifact                                                       | What the agent owns                                                 | What we do NOT build                      |

### The 12 capability bundles + proof bars

Each bundle composes existing backlog IDs; nothing here is a parallel scope. Bundles are ordered by the dependency chain, not priority.

### Build sequence (Proof Platform v1.1)

1. **Finish foundation gaps** — **0.9 FND-RUNTIME** (long missions must survive worker restarts before handoff is meaningful) → **0.2 cache stage**. _(Matches existing Build-order rollup step 1.)_
2. **C5 Strategic Briefing** — small, high-leverage; gives the swarm shared operating context.
3. **C1/C4 + C6 skeleton** — roster UI + read-only Trust Score; scoring math can come later.
4. **E1–E5** — the A2A primitives (protocol + tables + tracing). Hardest bundle; budget the most time here. **This is where C2 becomes true.**
5. **E6 Mission Graph** — the visualization on top of #4. Without #4 it's a fake screenshot.
6. **Bundle 6: Discover→Define→Plan slice + N1 GitHub-issues sync** — Plan stage writes real GitHub issues on approval.
7. **Bundle 9: Build + Test (I-thin, J-thin)** — Builder opens a real, scoped PR on the Supaprod repo and reads CI.
8. **Bundle 10: Ship (K-thin)** — approval-gated merge + deploy webhook ingest into Mission Graph.
9. **Bundle 11: Launch (L-thin)** — changelog + one outbound channel (Slack or email) with send-gate.
10. **Bundle 12: Support → Learn (M-thin + Z1)** — one inbound channel + Analyst outcome/re-score. **The full lifecycle loop closes here.**
11. **D3 polish** — make it the obvious "govern here" surface.
12. **O1/O2 lineage view + U6 Export** — anti-lock-in proof.

### Real-data seeding (default: Supaprod-on-Supaprod)

Bundles 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12 all run on real product data. **Default seed = Supaprod itself** (we run our own roadmap on Supaprod: real signals from this repo's issues, decisions, session-decisions log, feature-backlog; real PRs on this repo; real deploys; one outbound channel; one inbound support address). Most credible YC story ("we eat our own dog food") and no design-partner dependency. If a design partner is signed later, their product becomes an additional seed — not a replacement.

**Repo-write decision (Bundle 9):** Builder agent opens PRs on the **Supaprod repo itself** (option (a) from the plan). Requires a `GITHUB_TOKEN` runtime secret with `repo` scope; branch protection on `main` enforces that no agent can bypass review. To be added when Bundle 9 starts — not now.

### Demo narrative (one continuous mission, ~3 minutes)

> Operator updates the Strategic Briefing. Discovery ingests Supaprod's own signals and surfaces a re-ranked opportunity. Strategist drafts a PRD via A2A handoff. Planner proposes a sprint; one item is high-blast-radius → lands in Decision Queue. Operator approves. Orchestrator writes a **real GitHub issue**. Builder opens a **real PR** on the Supaprod repo, watches CI. CI passes. Merge gate fires → operator approves → **real merge** → **real deploy webhook** lands → Ship node lights up on Mission Graph. Growth drafts a **real changelog + outbound message**; operator approves; message **really sends**. Two days later, a **real support ticket** lands; Support agent triages and links it back to the same opportunity; Analyst attaches the outcome, re-scores the opportunity, writes the insight memo. The next Discovery cycle reflects the learning. Operator opens Product Memory → sees full lineage from ticket → opportunity → PRD → PR → deploy → ticket. Clicks Export.

Every step in that paragraph is real behavior on real systems, not a slide.

### Explicitly deferred (NOT in v1.1, NOT removed from the product)

External-facing **MCP / A2A interop** (Q — Supaprod exposing its agents to outside callers), advanced eval / drift / guardrail UIs beyond what the chokepoint already does, multi-product portfolio view (B3), BYO keys UI polish (A5), billing UI, full autonomous coding/IDE depth (we orchestrate GitHub via MCP; we do NOT replace Cursor/Devin), full helpdesk depth (one inbound channel only), marketing-automation depth (one outbound channel only), analytics dashboards (Learn is a re-score + insight memo). Positioning: _"agentic orchestration of the existing stack; each integration deepens over time."_

### New features this overlay adds to the backlog

These need feature entries written in full when their bundle becomes the next-up task. Stubbed here so the IDs are reserved:

- **C5 — Strategic Briefing surface** `[new]` · `P0` · `X1` — Single doc per product: north star, current goals, hard constraints, working agreements. Every agent loads it as system context. Versioned; changes propagate to in-flight missions on next step.
- **C6 — Agent Trust Score + Autonomy Dial** `[new]` · `P0` · `X1` — Per-agent score derived from eval pass-rate, approval-acceptance-rate, mission success-rate. Operator can move each agent along the trust arc (Observing → Proving → Trusted → Ambient) and the dial changes the default approval mode.
- **U6 — Full data portability / export** `[new]` · `P0` · `U` — Export signals, themes, opportunities, PRDs (markdown), decisions+lineage (JSON), agent configs (YAML), and the product-memory graph (JSON). One-click per product; scheduled exports later.
- **N1 — GitHub Issues sync (write)** `[new]` · `P0` · `H` — On approval of a sprint plan item, Orchestrator creates a real GitHub issue via GitHub MCP with title/body/labels and back-links to the PRD + opportunity. Bidirectional status sync read-only at first.
- **I-thin — Builder agent (scoped PR)** `[new]` · `P0` · `I` — Thin slice of S4: Builder picks one planned task, produces a small scoped diff, opens a real PR on the Supaprod repo via GitHub MCP. Blast-radius `high`; default approval mode `confirm`. NOT an autonomous IDE — scoped diffs only.
- **J-thin — CI-read for Builder** `[new]` · `P0` · `J` — Thin slice of S5: Builder reads GitHub Actions status on its open PR, surfaces failures, proposes a fix as a follow-up commit. No custom test runner.
- **K-thin — Merge gate + deploy webhook ingest** `[new]` · `P0` · `K` — Thin slice of S6: approval-gated merge via GitHub MCP; `/api/public/hooks/deploy` ingests deploy events from the existing platform (Cloudflare/Vercel) and posts a Ship node to the Mission Graph with deploy URL + commit SHA.
- **L-thin — Changelog + one outbound channel** `[new]` · `P0` · `L` — On ship event, Growth agent drafts a markdown changelog entry + a single outbound message (Slack OR email, one channel only for v1.1). Send is approval-gated. Real send via MCP/connector, no mocks.
- **M-thin — One inbound support channel** `[new]` · `P0` · `M` — Single inbound channel (email forward or webhook) ingests tickets into `signals` with `source='support'`. Support agent triages and links each ticket to a PRD or opportunity if matched.
- **Z1 — Analyst learn loop** `[new]` · `P0` · `O` — Analyst agent attaches a measured outcome to each shipped opportunity, re-scores it (ICE re-rank), writes a short insight memo, and feeds the result into Trust Score inputs. Closes the lifecycle loop back into Discover.

## How to read an entry

```text
ID. Feature name                         [status] · Pn · stage
   What     — one sentence: what it is.
   Build    — the granular sub-features (the actual checklist).
   States   — loading/empty/error/edge cases that must be handled.
   Done when— acceptance signal(s) that mark it shippable.
   Depends  — prerequisite IDs.
```

**Status** (from `docs/planning/archive/build-log.md` §2): `[reuse]` legacy survives largely as-is · `[extend]` legacy base + new work · `[new]` build from scratch · `[found]` foundation/non-functional (architecture, not a screen).

**Priority** (from `considerations.md` precedence, P0 highest): `P0` credible first user / built into foundation now · `P1` before/at first enterprise sale · `P2` scale & maturity.

**Stage**: lifecycle `S1`–`S9` (Discover→Learn) · platform `X1`–`X6` · `FND` foundation · `NFR` cross-cutting non-functional.

**Legend for the rollup tables:** ☐ not started · ◑ partial (legacy exists, needs hardening) · ☑ done & verified into the active build log.

## The 8 Cockpit Pillars Mapping

This feature backlog is organized under the **8 Cockpit Pillars** representing the end-to-end product lifecycle for a B2B Enterprise team. The 24 developer epics map directly into these pillars:

| Pillar                                     | Focus                    | Included Epics & Feature Scopes                                                        | Stable ID Ranges                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Pillar 8: Cockpit & Observability ("Miro for PMs")

_Focus: Swarm HUD, live DAGs, budget telemetry, governance gates, workspaces, auth, interop._

#### EPIC 0 — Foundation, tenancy & runtime `FND`

_The base every later stage is an addition to, not a rewrite of. Build order step 1._

**0.1 — Three-key tenancy + RLS** `[extend]` · `P0` · `FND`

- What: enforce `user_id` + `workspace_id` + `product_id` scoping on every table and RLS policy.
- Build: add `product_id` to all product-scoped tables; RLS policies for select/insert/update/delete keyed on all three; tenancy helper in server fns; deny-by-default policies; tenancy assertion in the chokepoint and orchestrator.
- States: missing-context request rejected (no silent cross-tenant read); workspace-with-no-product; product archived.
- Done when: an integration test proves a row created under (W1,P1) is invisible to (W1,P2) and (W2,\*) at the DB layer.
- Depends: A2 (session), B2 (product entity).

**0.2 — AI chokepoint pipeline** `[reuse]` · `P0` · `FND`

- What: the single path every model call takes (`src/lib/ai/runtime.server.ts`).
- Build: ordered stages — `budget → cache → pre-guard → retrieve(RAG) → PROVIDER → post-guard → persist(trace) → async eval → fallback`; one `ai_events` row + trace span per call; cache key salted by tenant (no cross-user poisoning); cache hit logs cost `$0.0000` explicitly.
- States: budget exceeded → throw before provider; cache hit → short-circuit but still log; guardrail block → abort + log; provider error → fallback chain.
- Done when: a call produces exactly one event + trace; budget throw fires before any provider spend; guardrail block aborts and is logged.
- Depends: 0.1, P1, P2.

**0.3 — Trust-stack tables** `[reuse]` · `P0` · `FND`

- What: the telemetry/governance schema the chokepoint writes to.
- Build: `ai_events`, `ai_traces`, `ai_evals`, `ai_feedback`, prompt-version tables, guardrail-rule tables, budget tables — all 3-key scoped, all with `parent_event_id` for trace nesting.
- Done when: schema migrations applied; chokepoint writes resolve; trace nesting renders in the viewer (P4).
- Depends: 0.1.

**0.4 — Design tokens & system** `[reuse]` · `P0` · `FND`

- What: OKLCH token system in `src/styles.css`; components consume tokens only.
- Build: semantic colors, gradients, shadows, `--surface-*` palette, type ramp, motion tokens, radii; `prefers-reduced-motion` hook; dark-first theme; lint/review guard against hex literals.
- Done when: a token edit changes the surface globally; a11y spot-check passes 4.5:1; no hex literals in components.
- Depends: —. See [`../design.md`](../../DESIGN.md).

**0.5 — Agent blast-radius limits** `[new]` · `P0` · `FND/NFR`

- What: hard scope limits on what any agent run may touch.
- Build: per-agent tool allow-list enforced at the chokepoint/orchestrator; resource scope (which products/tables/external systems); deny external side-effects without an approval gate; record attempted-out-of-scope actions.
- States: out-of-scope tool call → blocked + logged + surfaced in trace; escalates to Decision Queue if `confirm`.
- Done when: an agent cannot call a tool outside its allow-list, proven by test.
- Depends: 0.2, C2, D2.

**0.6 — Per-mission spend caps + global kill-switch** `[new]` · `P0` · `FND/NFR`

- What: cost ceilings per mission/agent and a one-action pause/stop for everything.
- Build: per-mission and per-workspace cost budgets; soft-warn → hard-stop thresholds; global kill-switch that pauses all running sessions and blocks new ones; per-agent run cap.
- States: cap reached mid-mission → checkpoint + pause (not data loss); kill-switch active → new runs refused with a clear message.
- Done when: a runaway mission halts at its cap with a resumable checkpoint; kill-switch drains running work safely.
- Depends: 0.6 needs P6 (budgets), E? (orchestration checkpoints).
- **How to use / verify (2026-06-03):**
  - **Where:** sidebar → AI Ops → **Governance** (`/_authenticated/governance`). Visible to any authenticated workspace member; system-pause toggle is admin-gated.
  - **Panels:**
    1. **Kill Switch** — workspace pause (owner/admin) with required reason; system pause is read-only for non-admins. When paused, `AppShell` shows a red banner on every route.
    2. **Mission Caps** — per-mission `mission_token_cap` + `mission_spend_cap_usd` with live usage bars (`tokens_used` / `spend_used_usd` from `agent_runs`). Auto-halts the run on exceedance.
    3. **Approvals** — pending `agent_approvals` with TTL countdown (default 24h), `escalation_state`, and Approve / Reject / Extend actions.
  - **Server enforcement:** `callModel()` and `callModelStream()` in `src/lib/ai/runtime.server.ts` call `current_kill_state()` + `check_mission_caps()` before spend and throw `GovernanceHaltError`; the agent loop catches it, calls `halt_agent_run()`, and finalizes the run with `status='halted'`. Blocked attempts log `ai_events.status='blocked'` with `error_message='governance_halt:<kind>'`.
  - **Cron:** `pg_cron` hits `/api/public/hooks/approvals-tick` every minute → expires approvals past `expires_at` and flips `escalation_state`.
  - **Verification checklist:** (a) toggle workspace pause → start any mission → call is rejected with a `governance_halt:kill_switch` event; (b) set a tiny `mission_spend_cap_usd` on a run → next step halts with `governance_halt:mission_spend_cap` and the run row shows `status='halted'`; (c) leave an approval past its `expires_at` → within ~1 min it shows expired in the Approvals panel.

**0.7 — Prompt-injection defense** `[new]` · `P0` · `FND/NFR`

- What: treat all ingested/external content (signals, tickets, MCP/A2A results, web) as untrusted.
- Build: input sanitization + delimiting; instruction-isolation prompt pattern; injection classifier on ingested text; external tool-result quarantine before it can drive an action; high-risk actions require approval regardless of agent mode.
- States: detected injection → flag + strip + log; unverified external instruction never auto-executes a side-effect.
- Done when: a seeded poisoned signal cannot trigger an autonomous external action without approval.
- Depends: 0.2, F1, Q2.

**0.8 — Provider/model fallback & graceful degradation** `[new]` · `P0` · `FND/NFR`

- What: the product keeps working when a model/gateway is down or deprecated.
- Build: ordered fallback routing per surface; health checks; circuit-breaker per provider; degraded-mode UX (queue/retry, not hard-fail); model-deprecation playbook + config.
- States: primary provider 5xx/timeout → next in chain; all down → queue + friendly degraded state.
- Done when: killing the primary provider in a test still returns answers via fallback.
- Depends: 0.2, 5a (model gateway + BYO).

**0.9 — Durable runtime for long/parallel missions** `[new]` · `P0` · `FND/NFR`

- What: missions survive Cloudflare Workers execution limits.
- Build: durable job/queue model; checkpointing + resume; backpressure; idempotent ticks; long-op state in DB not memory.
- States: worker eviction mid-step → resume from last checkpoint; duplicate tick → no double effect.
- Done when: a multi-step mission survives a forced worker restart and completes.
- Depends: 0.2, E5/E6 (parallel sessions), architecture/orchestration.md.

**0.10 — Sandboxed execution + review gate for agent code** `[new]` · `P0` · `FND/NFR`

- What: agent-written code runs isolated and is reviewed before merge/deploy.
- Build: sandboxed exec environment; no ambient secrets in sandbox; mandatory human/policy review gate before merge; supply-chain allow-list for agent-installed deps.
- Done when: agent code executes without access to prod secrets; no merge without passing the review gate.
- Depends: I1 (Studio), K1 (PR/deploy), S1.

**0.11 — App monitoring, backups & DR** `[new]` · `P0/P1` · `FND/NFR`

- What: platform-level (not just AI) observability + recoverability.
- Build: uptime/error/latency monitoring + alerting; DB backups + point-in-time restore; restore drill; basic status signal.

#### EPIC A — Identity & access `X6`

**A1 — Sign up / onboarding** `[reuse]` · `P0` · `X6`

- What: account creation + first-run setup.
- Build: email+password + Google OAuth; create first workspace + product; capture display name, timezone, working hours; email verification on by default; sample/template seed (ties W1 onboarding).
- States: duplicate email; unverified email; OAuth cancel; partial onboarding resume.
- Done when: a new user lands in a seeded, usable workspace with a product.
- Depends: 0.1.

**A2 — Login / logout / session** `[reuse]` · `P0` · `X6`

- Build: authenticated session; sign-out-everywhere; session refresh; `Last-Event-ID` resume for SSE streams; global auth middleware on all `_authenticated.*` routes.
- States: expired token; refresh failure; stream resume after reconnect.
- Done when: streams resume after a reconnect; sign-out invalidates all sessions.
- Depends: 0.1.

**A3 — Password reset / email verification** `[reuse]` · `P0` · `X6`

- Build: reset request → email → set-new; verification link; rate-limited.
- States: expired/used token; unknown email (no enumeration leak).

**A4 — Profile & preferences** `[reuse]` · `P0` · `X6`

- Build: display name, role, timezone, working hours, default model per surface.
- Done when: greeting, scheduling windows, and model routing all read these values.
- Depends: A1.

**A5 — BYO model keys** `[reuse]` · `P0` · `X6`

- Build: add/test/rotate/delete provider keys; encrypted (pgsodium); masked display; per-provider validation ping.
- States: invalid key; rotation while a mission is mid-run; revoked key fallback to gateway.
- Done when: a BYO key is used for the chosen surface and never rendered in plaintext.
- Depends: 0.8, S4.

**A6 — Roles & membership (future)** `[new]` · `P1` · `X6`

- Build: invite flow; per-workspace roles (owner/admin/member/viewer); SSO/SAML readiness; RBAC enforcement at RLS + UI.
- Depends: 0.1, B1. (See S6.)

---

#### EPIC B — Workspaces & products `X2`

**B1 — Create / switch workspace** `[extend]` · `P0` · `X2`

- Build: workspace as top-level tenancy boundary; create/rename/switch; membership stub.
- States: last-workspace delete guard; switch persists per session.

**B2 — Create product under workspace** `[extend]` · `P0` · `X2`

- Build: product entity with vision/problem/target-users/metrics/stage; create/edit; `product_id` scoping everywhere.
- Done when: a second product under the same workspace is fully isolated (see 0.1).

**B3 — Product switcher + portfolio view** `[new]` · `P1` · `X2`

- Build: fast product switcher (⌘K + header); cross-product portfolio overview (health, activity, budgets per product).
- States: zero products; many products (search/scroll).

**B4 — Per-product isolation** `[extend]` · `P0` · `X2`

- Done when: covered by the 0.1 isolation test extended to agents/memory/budgets.

**B5 — Archive / delete product** `[new]` · `P1` · `X2`

- Build: archive (soft, reversible) + delete (hard, with export prompt); cascade rules; audit entry.
- States: delete with running missions → block or drain; archived product hidden from switcher but queryable.
- Depends: U2 (export), U1 (retention/deletion).

---

#### EPIC C — Agents (configuration) `X1`

**C1 — Agent roster** `[extend]` · `P0` · `X1`

- Build: list durable lifecycle agents + spawned sub-agents per product; status dots; last-run summary.
- Done when: the roster shows the ~10 durable agents (`docs/planning/archive/build-log.md` §6) + live sub-agents.

**C2 — Create / clone / configure agent** `[reuse]` · `P0` · `X1`

- Build: schema `slug, name, system_prompt, tool_allowlist[], default_model, temperature/top_p/seed, max_tokens, schedule_cron?, approval_mode(auto|confirm|review), memory_enabled`; clone from template; validation.
- States: invalid prompt/model; tool not permitted; duplicate slug.

- States: disabled mid-schedule; overlapping runs deduped.

**C4 — Agent detail + run history + memory inspector** `[reuse]` · `P1` · `X1`

- Build: last runs (status/duration/score/cost); memory inspector (shared vs private); per-agent eval coverage.
- Depends: P1, O1.

---

#### EPIC E — Agent communication, coordination & transfer `X1` _(the autonomous spine — do not defer)_

**E1 — Sub-agent spawning** `[done]` · `P1` · `X1`

- Built (MVP): any agent inside a mission spawns the next hop via `agent.handoff` → `enqueueHandoff` (inserts a `queued` `agent_runs` row + structured `agent_messages` row). Spawned runs inherit the chokepoint, the user's tool allow-list, the workspace brief, and their own autonomy arc. Lifecycle = `queued → running → completed/failed`, all rows tied to the mission via `mission_id`.
- Out (deferred): dedicated `agent.spawn` tool with fan-out semantics (folded into Bundle 5 alongside E4 polish).
- See: `docs/a2a-handoff.md`.

**E2 — Agent-to-agent (internal) messaging** `[done]` · `P1` · `X1`

- Built: `agent_messages` table — one structured payload per hop (`from/to_agent`, `kind`, `payload jsonb`, source run/trace, consumer run, `created_at` for ordering). RLS scoped to workspace members. Receiver loads its inbound message via `consumeInboundHandoff` and gets it injected as a `--- Handoff from {agent} ---` block in its system prompt. Receiver never sees a pasted prompt — only a typed JSON payload.
- Out (deferred): loop-guard / message-cap is currently implicit (mission scope + sweeper backpressure). Explicit per-mission message cap is a Bundle 5 polish item.

**E3 — Agent transfer / handoff** `[done]` · `P1` · `X1`

- Built: `missions` table groups every hop. `agent.handoff` tool (write/confirm) takes `to_agent_slug + task + context + artifacts + open_questions + constraints` and enqueues the receiver as a new `agent_runs` row with the same `mission_id`. Receiver inherits brief + structured handoff block; references artifacts by ID and re-reads them with its own tools (no game-of-telephone summarization). Done-when met: a Planner→Engineer→QA chain runs with each stage's first system prompt carrying the prior stage's structured payload.
- See: `docs/a2a-handoff.md` "Why structured payloads".

**E4 — Parallel sub-agents** `[done — schema; UI deferred]` · `P1` · `X1`

- Built: schema supports parallel hops on a single mission — no serial constraint on `agent_messages`, no FK preventing two queued runs sharing a `mission_id`. The resume-runs sweeper promotes them subject to per-workspace concurrency cap (5).
- Out (deferred): a fan-out tool (`agent.spawn` returning N message ids) + merge-result step in the parent agent. Both fold cleanly into Bundle 5.

**E5 — Parallel agent sessions** `[done]` · `P1` · `X1`

- Built: two missions in the same workspace run concurrently up to the FND-RUNTIME 0.9 backpressure cap (`MAX_RUNNING_PER_WORKSPACE = 5`). Above that, additional missions sit `queued` and are promoted by the sweeper. Per-mission isolation is enforced by `mission_id` on `agent_runs` + `agent_messages` and by RLS scoping to `workspace_members`. No cross-bleed possible — each run loads only its own inbound handoff and writes only to its own mission.

**E6 — Orchestration / mission graph view** `[done]` · `P1` · `X1`

- Built (2026-06-04): live DAG on `/missions/$id` via `src/components/cadence/MissionGraph.tsx`. Pure-SVG, no external graph lib. Nodes = `agent_runs` rows; edges = `agent_messages` (`source_run_id → consumed_by_run_id`, fallback to next hop matching `to_agent_slug` while in flight). Layout = BFS-depth columns × chronological rows; fan-out renders as parallel rows in the child column. Status color + glyph mirror the hop card; click = expand+scroll target hop; keyboard accessible. Re-uses the existing 2s refetch loop while mission `status='running'`.
- How to use / verify: dispatch any mission from `/agents` with "Start as mission" → open `/missions/{id}` → Mission graph card sits above the Agent timeline. Single-agent mission ⇒ 1 node, 0 edges. Multi-hop ⇒ N nodes + labelled handoff edges, updating live. Click a node ⇒ matching hop card expands + scrolls into view; per-hop `/traces/$traceId` link still works.
- Deferred to later: pause/steer-from-graph controls, zoom/collapse for very large graphs (>20 nodes), per-node cost/token rollup pill (data available once we surface it in `getMission`).
- Depends: E1–E5, P.

**E7 — Shared vs. private memory** `[extend]` · `P1` · `X1`

- Build: mission-shared context + per-agent long-term memory with importance decay; access rules (no leakage across missions/products).
- Depends: O1, 0.1.

- Build: daily/monthly caps per workspace/product/mission; BudgetBar (today vs cap, month vs cap; muted→accent→destructive; per-surface popover); breach is friendly (not a crash).
- Done when: a breach degrades gracefully and the BudgetBar reflects burn. See `docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md` BudgetBar.
- Depends: 0.6, V1.

**P7 — Incidents log** `[reuse]` · `P1` · `X3`

- Build: record safety/guardrail/cost incidents; link to traces; resolution notes.

**P8 — AI message UI contract** `[reuse]` · `P0` · `X3`

- Build: one shared component rendering score/model+via/latency/tokens/cost/citations/feedback/view-trace/replay on every AI message; cache hit shows `$0.0000`; no citations box when `retrieval=false`.
- Done when: every AI surface (chat, copilot, PRD `/ai`, Studio, agent summaries, brief) uses the one contract component. Non-negotiable per `docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md` + `AGENTS.md` rule 9.
- Depends: P1, O2.

---

#### EPIC Q — Interop (agent-native) `X5`

**Q1 — MCP server + client** `[new]` · `P2` · `X5`

- Build: expose Supaprod capabilities as MCP tools (server); consume external MCP tools (client); capability scopes; rate limits; audit.
- States: untrusted tool result → quarantine (0.7); scope-exceeded call blocked.
- Done when: an external agent calls a scoped Supaprod tool and the call is audited.
- Depends: 0.7, S5.

- Build: Google Docs/Notion two-way sync, Linear pull/push + Sync Inbox, Google Calendar read+write, GitHub, Slack, CRM; integration health surface; OAuth + token storage (encrypted); reuse Nango engine (`nango/`); known limits: Docs sync drops comments, Notion BFS reorder fixed.
- States: token expired; sync conflict; partial sync; rate limit.
- Done when: at least Docs/Notion/Linear/Calendar round-trip with health visible. See `integrations` epic in `docs/planning/archive/build-log.md` §5.
- Depends: A5/secrets, nango.

## Recent Additions & Triage

## New features — v2 Positioning Session (2026-06-02)

_Derived from strategic repositioning to "autonomous product OS." Full reasoning: [`strategy/product-positioning-v2.md`](../strategy/archive/v2-positioning.md)._

**C5 — Strategic Briefing surface** `[status: ☑ shipped 2026-06-04]` · `P0` · `X1`

- What: one place where the operator defines mission, target user, current focus, anti-goals and notes once; every agent reads it as their operating context before each mission.
- Built: `workspace_briefs` table (one per workspace; mission / target_user / current_focus / anti_goals / notes; member-read, owner-write RLS). Editor at `/_authenticated/briefing` (5 textareas with hint copy + char counts + Save). `renderBriefBlock()` helper emits a labelled fenced text block (skipped when every field is empty). Agent loop injects the rendered block **between the agent's persona prompt and memory recall** in `src/lib/ai/loop.server.ts` so Discovery / Strategist / Builder all see the operator's shared context first. Migration also added `prds.github_issue_url` + a `prd.link_issue` tool to close PRD↔issue link-back.
- Done when: ✅ a mission's system prompt visibly contains the brief; editing the brief changes the next mission's plan.
- Depends: C2, G2 (editor), O2 (RAG context).

##### How to use / verify

- **Where to find it.** Sidebar → **Briefing** (Crosshair icon, pinned right after Today). Route: `/briefing`.
- **What each control does.** Five textareas — **Mission** (what this workspace exists to do), **Target user (ICP)** (who you're building for), **Current focus** (this quarter's priorities), **Anti-goals** (what to refuse to spend effort on), **Notes** (tone / constraints / decisions). Top-right **Save brief** button (disabled until dirty).
- **Server enforcement.** Read via `getActiveBrief` server fn (workspace-member RLS). Write via `upsertBrief` (workspace-owner only — RLS rejects everyone else). Brief content is injected into the agent loop's system prompt _before_ the tools list and quarantined tool-output rules, so it can't be overridden by tool output.
- **Verification checklist:** (1) Open `/briefing`, type a Current focus + Anti-goal, hit Save (toast confirms). (2) Run a mission from `/agents` (Discovery Scout / PRD Writer / Strategist). (3) Open the trace at `/traces/{trace_id}` and inspect the first model call's system prompt — the **Workspace Strategic Brief** block must appear between the persona prompt and the tools list. (4) Edit the brief, re-run the mission, confirm the Strategist's draft now reflects the new focus and refuses the anti-goal.

**C6 — Agent Trust Score + Autonomy Dial** `[status: ☑ shipped 2026-06-04]` · `P0` · `X1`

- What: each agent shows a visible trust score (0–100) computed from mission outcomes, approval acceptance, and eval scores; the operator places the agent on the trust arc (Observing → Proving → Trusted → Ambient) via an inline dial, and that arc composes with each tool's own approval mode in the agent loop.
- Built: `agent_autonomy` table (one row per user+agent, owner-only RLS). Trust score computed on read (`src/lib/ai/trust.server.ts → computeAllAgentTrust`) with Bayesian shrinkage so a 1-run agent doesn't show 100%. `resolveApprovalMode(toolMode, arc)` is the single combiner: Observing forces `review`, Proving forces `confirm`, Trusted lets `confirm` tools run inline, Ambient lets everything except hard-locked tools run inline. Safety floor preserved: `review` is sticky, and `calendar.create` keeps `confirm` even at Ambient. Server fns `getAllAgentTrust` + `setAgentArc` in `src/lib/trust.functions.ts`. UI: Trust chip (color-tiered, hover tooltip with full breakdown + formula) on each agent button and detail header; AutonomyDial (4 arc buttons + suggested-arc hint) inside the agent detail card.
- Out of scope (later): trust history chart, auto-promotion on sustained score, E8 Loop Health Monitor.
- Done when: ✅ dialing Discovery Scout from Observing → Trusted causes the next mission's `confirm`-mode tool to execute inline instead of queueing in the Decision Queue, and the trace shows `status:"executed"`.
- Depends: C2, D3, P1.

##### How to use / verify

- **Canonical explanation:** see [`docs/trust-and-autonomy.md`](../features/trust-and-autonomy.md) — operator-facing meaning of the 0–100 scale, the three ingredients (40/30/30), the four arc levels, safety floors, and the operator playbook. Linked from `architecture/orchestration.md`.
- **Where to find it.** Route `/agents`. Trust chip appears on each agent in the left roster and at the top of the right-hand detail card. The Autonomy Dial sits inside the detail card, just under the agent persona.
- **What each control does.** **Trust chip** (e.g. `Trust 72 · Trusted`) — the qualitative label is derived from the score band (`At-risk` / `Observing` / `Proving` / `Trusted` / `Ambient`; `New` until ≥3 samples). Hover (Radix tooltip) shows the 0–100 scale + Bayesian shrinkage explanation, then the weighted breakdown: Missions 40%, Approvals 30%, Evals 30% with raw counts and the suggested arc. **Autonomy Dial** — 4 buttons (Observing · Proving · Trusted · Ambient); each button has its own tooltip describing exactly what it does to `auto` / `confirm` / `review` tools. Clicking one writes `agent_autonomy` for that user+agent. The suggested arc is shown when it differs from the current arc.
- **Server enforcement.** `setAgentArc` server fn writes via `requireSupabaseAuth`; RLS on `agent_autonomy` restricts everyone to their own rows. The agent loop (`src/lib/ai/loop.server.ts`) calls `loadAgentArc` once per run and `resolveApprovalMode(toolMode, arc)` at every tool-call gate. `review` mode is sticky (never downgraded). `calendar.create` is hard-locked: even at Ambient it forces `confirm`.
- **Verification checklist:** (1) Open `/agents` — every agent card shows a Trust chip with qualitative label (first-time users see `Trust 50 · New`). (2) Hover the chip — Radix tooltip explains the scale, formula, and full breakdown. (3) Hover each arc button — each shows what that arc does to `auto` / `confirm` / `review` tools. (4) Dispatch a goal on **Discovery Scout** with the dial at **Observing** → the action is queued for review (visible at `/decisions` or `/traces` with `status:"queued"`). (5) Flip to **Trusted** → re-dispatch → a `confirm`-mode tool executes inline (trace step `status:"executed"`). (6) At **Ambient**, confirm `calendar.create` still hard-forces `confirm` (safety floor).

**E8 — Loop Health Monitor** `[new]` · `P1` · `X1`

- What: single view showing whether the autonomous product loop is running, where it's stuck, and what needs human attention — the "is my product org operating?" dashboard.
- Build: per-product loop status (active missions, stalled missions, approval queue depth, last signal ingest, last deploy); health score composite; alert when loop stalls >N hours; one-click resume from each stall point.
- States: healthy (all stages active); degraded (one stage stalled); stalled (multiple stages blocked or no activity).
- Done when: stall in the Discover stage appears in the monitor within 1 hour with the reason and unblock action.
- Depends: E6 (orchestration graph), D3, F3.

**N3 — Mission Compounding View** `[new]` · `P2` · `S9`

- What: show how each mission built on previous memory — make Product Memory accumulation visible and rewarding; counter the "is it getting smarter?" question.
- Build: per-mission "context used" panel (which past decisions, signals, outcomes informed this mission's plan); memory growth chart (nodes + edges over time); "this mission referenced N prior decisions" badge; exportable context snapshot.
- States: first mission (no prior context, explain what will be remembered); mature product (rich context graph visible).
- Done when: a mission trace shows which prior Product Memory nodes were retrieved and used in the plan.
- Depends: O1, O2, N1, N2.

**U6 — Full data portability / export** `[new]` · `P1` · `NFR`

- What: export all product data in open, standard formats — the anti-lock-in commitment made concrete. Operator can take their data to any tool at any time.
- Build: export wizard (per product or workspace); exports: signals (CSV/JSON), themes + opportunities (JSON), decisions + lineage (JSON), PRDs (Markdown), task graphs (JSON), agent configs (YAML), Product Memory graph (JSON), trace logs (JSON); scheduled export option; export audit log.
- States: large export (async + download link); partial export (per-data-type selection); export history.
- Done when: a full workspace export produces files importable into standard tools (CSV → spreadsheet, Markdown → Notion, JSON → any processor).
- Depends: B4, O1, G2, plan.md §9 (portability commitment).

**W6 — Persona-specific onboarding tracks** `[new]` · `P0` · `NFR`

- What: three onboarding paths matching the three primary personas — each emphasises the pain point most relevant to that user type and gets them to first value faster.
- Build: onboarding flow selector post-signup (Solo PM / Founding PM / Technical Founder); per-track: different sample data, different first-mission suggestion, different "first win" moment; track stored in profile; can switch tracks.
- States: existing user (skip or re-run track); partial onboarding (resume).
- Done when: each track gets a user to their first completed mission in <10 min (time-to-value measured).
- Depends: A1, W1, C5 (Strategic Briefing seeded as part of onboarding).

## v3 Audit Triage (2026-06-06)

_Derived from [`./strategy/archive/v3-audit.md`](../strategy/archive/v3-audit.md) (22 product RECs) and [`./strategy/archive/v3-audit-language.md`](../strategy/archive/v3-audit-language.md) (10 LANG + tooltip + IA + outcome + chip recs). Operator-approved A→C→B sequence; this triage **is** Phase C. Each F-ID below is a thin entry pointing back to the audit doc for full body + impact/effort/horizon scoring — do not duplicate that prose here._

**Owner column:** any tool may pick a row whose own status isn't `☑`. Update Live status board's "Now building" before starting. Cross-tool rules: [`../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) §10.

| `F-NAV-ACCORDION`     | Sidebar groups behave as single-open accordion: clicking a group auto-collapses the others; the active route's group auto-opens; `localStorage` persists one id. Implemented in `src/components/cadence/AppShell.tsx` only. **Why:** addresses operator feedback that the left rail felt crowded; pairs with `F-IA-MERGE-OBSERVE` to clean up the AI Ops area without hiding features. **How to verify:** open `/agents` → "Agents" group is the only one expanded; click "Deliver" → "Agents" auto-collapses; refresh → last-opened group restored. | operator-fb · pairs with REC-12     | Lovable |   ☑    |

Govern group untouched (Guardrails · Governance · Budgets · Integrations). **How to use / verify:** sidebar → Run → Observe; default Analytics tab; switching tabs updates `?tab=`; visiting `/analytics`, `/traces`, or `/drift` redirects to the matching tab; ⌘K resolves "Observe"; Trace detail still opens at `/traces/<id>`. **Implementation:** new `src/routes/_authenticated.observe.tsx` + `src/components/observe/{Analytics,Traces,Drift}Panel.tsx`; old route files reduced to `beforeLoad: redirect(...)`; sidebar group `aiops` → `run` with 2 items in `src/components/cadence/AppShell.tsx`. | REC-12 · operator-fb      | Lovable |          ☑           |

| `F-OUTCOME-SURFACE` | Ship `/outcome` (Releases · Launches · Support · Learnings) and the 5 missing right-half loop surfaces (Release · Launch · Support · Learn · Outcome) in shadow form so operators _see_ the loop they're sold. Maps to Proof Platform v1.1 bundles 10–12 (Ship · Launch · Support→Learn). Empty surfaces are fine if the loop is named. **How to use / verify:** open the sidebar → **Outcome** group → `/outcome`. Four tabs: **Releases** (completed missions + completed agent runs with duration/tokens/cost), **Launches** (approvals on outbound tools `send_slack`/`send_email`/`publish_changelog`/`post_announcement`/`notify_channel` — pending rows link to `/inbox`), **Support** (signals with `source` in `support`/`ticket`/`helpdesk`/`email`/`zendesk`/`intercom`/`freshdesk`), **Learnings** (opportunities whose `updated_at` is >60s after `created_at` — proxy for re-scoring). Each tab is empty by design until upstream events arrive; empty state names the loop step + why it lights up. All reads go through `getOutcomeData` in `src/lib/outcome.functions.ts` (RLS-scoped via `requireSupabaseAuth`). No new agent logic; no chokepoint bypass. | REC-07 · LANG-NEW-OUTCOME |  any  | ☑ shipped 2026-06-06 |

| `F-SEC-REALTIME-RLS` | `realtime.messages` has no RLS — any authenticated user can subscribe to any channel topic. Operator picked "ignore for now, track as backlog F-ID". Fix requires (a) renaming every `supabase.channel()` call site to `workspace:<id>:…` / `user:<auth.uid()>:…` topic convention, then (b) RLS on `realtime.messages` enforcing topic regex against workspace membership. Higher risk than payoff today (no PII broadcast on realtime; row reads still RLS-protected). | supabase_lov scanner `realtime_messages_no_channel_auth` | ☐ (deferred by operator) |

#### Triage notes (apply when picking a row)

- **Most P0 rows are pure copy.** No schema change, no server-fn change, no migration. Estimate is hours-per-route, not days.
- **`F-IA-*` merges break URLs.** Always add redirects in the same commit; never ship a rename without `<Navigate>` from old route.
- **`F-AGENTS-ROSTER-CUT` is a data change**, not a code change — update seed data + the agent roster server fn, leave the spawn pipeline alone.
- **`F-OUTCOME-SURFACE` is Phase B** - claim it via the SSOT live cursor ([`SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`](./SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md) section 0) before another tool does; bundles 10-12 collapse into this one F-ID.
- **Don't expand prose here.** Full bodies live in the two audit docs. This section is the addressable index.

> **▶ This table is the canonical "what do I build next?" source.** To resolve the next actionable task deterministically (any tool, any human):
>
> 1. Take the **lowest-numbered step** that is still `◑` or `☐` (the `∥` cross-cutting row is pulled into step 1, not sequenced separately).
> 2. Expand its **Key IDs** to the feature entries above; pick the first whose own `[status]` is not `☑`.
> 3. Open its concrete ticket in [`archive/foundation-audit.md`](./archive/foundation-audit.md) (step 1) or its entry above (later steps), then build.
>
> The SSOT, [`SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`](./SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md) (section 0 + section 3), carries the live cursor and day-to-day build queue - it points here for the concrete F-ID scope behind the next step.
