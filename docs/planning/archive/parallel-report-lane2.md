# Parallel build — Lane 2 report

> _Created: 2026-06-22 · Last updated: 2026-07-02_

> Lane 2 of the numbered parallel build (`parallel/lane-2`, worktree `cadence-lane-2`). Identity is the lane NUMBER, not a theme; picks the highest-RANKED free item via `bash scripts/lane.sh next`. Per-cycle loop + rules: [`../../operations/autonomous-build-loop.md`](../../operations/autonomous-build-loop.md) §15-16; lane-local config: `.remember/LANE.md` (git-ignored). This file is the run log; the master status board is [`../feature-dashboard.md`](../feature-dashboard.md).

### ▶ 2026-07-02 16:50 — OBS-03 shipped (primitive library), board dry on real dependency, long-polling

**Shipped this cycle:** OBS-03, the Obsidian v3 core primitive library. Claimed atomically (`lane.sh claim OBS-03`, precise file globs to avoid OBS-02's `_authenticated.*.tsx` overlap), built all 11 primitives + barrel in `src/components/obsidian/` (Button, MonoLabel, StatusDot, VerdictChip, AuroraCard, Citation, PencilNote, Toast singleton, SlideOver on `@radix-ui/react-dialog`, CallCard, MissionRow), wrote 15 pure-logic/shallow-element unit tests (this repo has zero jsdom/happy-dom, so tests call `Component.render(props, ref)` directly rather than adding new DOM-test infra). Ran a 5-lens adversarial-review Workflow (token-purity, restraint-budget, a11y, humanized-output, prototype-parity) + a skeptical verify pass; fixed every confirmed finding (wrong `StatusDot` queued-state token, `Toast`'s live region mounting/unmounting instead of staying persistent, `Citation`'s missing `aria-describedby`, a couple of off-token pixel values, `MonoLabel` reuse). Fixed a real tsconfig gap along the way (`*.test.tsx` wasn't excluded like `*.test.ts`, so the repo's first `.test.tsx` file would've typechecked without `bun:test`'s ambient types). Gates: tsc 0, 15 new / 1889 total tests pass. Committed + fast-forward pushed to `origin/main` (`6bb01ca121`), verified landed by `git cat-file -e origin/main:src/components/obsidian/index.ts`. Full detail: `docs/features/obsidian-port.md` OBS-03 section, `plan.md` §4.

**Deliberately deferred, not skipped:** the dev-only `/obsidian-specimen` route. Its file (`src/routes/_authenticated.obsidian-specimen.tsx`) matches OBS-02's active claim glob on `src/routes/_authenticated.*.tsx`; `lane.sh claim` correctly refused it (exit 3, CONFLICT). Claim stays held (lane2, heartbeat fresh) until OBS-02 releases that glob, then the specimen route is a small follow-up. This does not block OBS-04..09 — they only need `@/components/obsidian`, which is complete.

**Board check after landing OBS-03:** `bash scripts/lane.sh next` returns `OBS-PORT, OBS-04, OBS-05, OBS-06, OBS-07, OBS-08, OBS-09, OBS-10` — mechanically eligible, but verified by hand that every one is still genuinely blocked, not just formally: `src/components/obsidian/Surface.tsx` (OBS-02's own claimed file) does not exist yet, and `src/routes/_authenticated.tsx` does not carry `[data-obsidian]` anywhere. OBS-02 (lane1) has held its claim 79+ minutes without shipping. Building any surface (04-09) now would mean rendering it outside the Obsidian scope entirely (unstyled/wrong theme) since the shell that applies the attribute doesn't exist. `OBS-PORT` is the umbrella tracking row, not directly buildable (its sub-items are). This matches lane3's own board-dry log from ~65 minutes ago (`eafaa9f8ec`, "OBS 04-10 all hard-blocked on OBS-02/03 foundation") — still true even though OBS-03 itself is now done, because the remaining real blocker was always OBS-02.

**Long-polling.** No genuinely buildable Tier-1/3 item exists right now beyond what's already claimed by other lanes. Rechecking in ~25 minutes for OBS-02 to land (or any other eligible item to appear).

---

### ▶ BOARD DRY — long-polling (2026-06-25, new session start)

`bash scripts/lane.sh next` → exit 2: "BOARD DRY: no eligible Tier-1/Tier-3 ⬜/◐ item unclaimed + not done"

**Board state verified:** The v11 Tier-1 front (#1-21) is complete — all items are ✅ on origin/main except LANDING-PAGE-V11 (explicitly parked ⬜), M1/LRN-01 (👤 Gated), HUMAN-SWEEP (⏭️ deferred), and EMBED-CHOKEPOINT (◐, pinned chokepoint claim, gated). All Tier-3 items (EVALS-PRIMITIVE, AGENT-FLEET-VIEW, DEF-04, REPO-DECLUTTER-V11, DELEGATE-DESK, TRUST-VERIFY) are either ✅ on origin/main or confirmed in the local DONE registry. No Tier-1/3 ⬜/◐ item is unclaimed and not done.

**Gates confirmed clean:** tsc clean (0 errors), 1541/1541 tests pass, rebased on origin/main.

**What unlocks next work (founder-gated):**
- GitHub OAuth App registration → unblocks SEN-01 / F-CONN (live connectors) + Q2 (outward A2A)
- Stripe live keys → enables credits engine go-live
- SANDBOX provider pick → unblocks DEF-04 AI-mockup generative half
- pg_cron migration `20260625000000` → apply via Lovable dashboard (ambient cron schedules)
- EMBED-CHOKEPOINT (rank 21) → attended session needed for AI-core edits

**Long-polling:** re-checking in ~25 min in case a sibling lane or founder action opens a new row.

## RESUME CURSOR (read first) — after 14 cycles

**State:** 14 cycles done this run (… CORE-UX-TRUST `◐` #10, then **CORE-UX-FELT `◐` #11** this cycle). On `parallel/lane-2`, even with `origin/main`, claim released.

**Founder steers now STANDING (in memory + docs):**
1. **Build the ranked board top-down; decide IA/design yourself** — park ONLY what needs founder input or is chokepoint-pinned (`ai/*`). (memory `build-dont-overpark`)
2. **Whole-register coverage + class-of-work order** (AGENTS.md §3): untouched `⬜` FIRST → partial `◐` SECOND (top-down) → pure design THIRD. Halt ONLY on a genuine founder-creative/strategic call or a secret I don't hold. A UI I can't visually verify is NOT a halt.
3. **Compact AFTER each completed cycle, NEVER mid-cycle** — via ScheduleWakeup, then continue.
4. **NO BLOCKCHAIN anywhere now** (memory `no-blockchain-trust-integrity`): integrity = a plain SHA-256 fingerprint for EVERY user, NOT enterprise/blockchain; signing/persistence deferred OPTIONAL.

**🛑 GENUINE-STOP IS LIKELY REACHED — the next cycle should probably STOP + surface to the founder.** After 14 cycles, the autonomous front is EXHAUSTED. Honest map of everything remaining (verify with `lane.sh next` + `lane.sh list` + the dashboard each time, in case lane 1 added rows, but expect no clean slice):
- **Chokepoint-pinned (`ai/*`, off-limits):** BRAIN-UX #8 (AI open-analyst ceiling), DBR #22 (supersession engine), CORE-UX-TRUST's auto-clear-gates (loop approval-mode).
- **Founder-gated (a secret or his voice):** ORCH-DELEGATE #15 (Linear API key + BLD-04), INTEROP #16 (outward WRITE/A2A scoped-token = security-scope/audit), POS-V11 #20 + LANDING-PAGE-V11 #21 (founder-voice copy), KI-39-type cron/AI-spend activation.
- **Lane-1 / other-lane domain:** REPO-DECLUTTER #28 (lane 1's active doc-reorg thread — they did the feature-backlog archive), IA-DEPTH-V11 #23 + `govern.tsx` de-jargon, DESIGN-V11 #24 (Tier-2 founder-prompted design).
- **Marginal / not a clean slice:** CORE-UX-FELT's de-jargon `LoopStations` (marginal wording).
- **Founder-prompted Tier-4 (last):** DEMO-SEED-RICH, SHIP-V11, HUMAN-SWEEP.

**So next cycle: reap + `lane.sh next` + `lane.sh list`; if (as expected) nothing offers a clean, substantive, autonomously-buildable slice, DO NOT build hollow/marginal work — STOP and give the founder the concise status + per-item reason (above) + a recommendation (e.g., publish + live-test the 14-cycle run; or unblock one gated item by providing a key / a positioning decision / lifting a chokepoint pin for an attended session). This is the founder-approved stop.**

## 2026-06-24 — Cycle 14: CORE-UX-FELT ◐ — harden the wedge's first-run failure path (v11 #11)

**Pick:** untouched ⬜ exhausted (ORCH Linear-key, POS/LANDING founder-copy, REPO-DECLUTTER + DELEGATE-DESK + AGENT-FLEET = lane 1). Class-2 ◐: CORE-UX-FELT #11's last substantive remainder = harden the wedge's hard-failure path (the cold-gateway RUN path was already graceful via a null verdict; the gap was the error path's raw toast).

**Built:** the Critic-teardown wedge (the cold-start first impression) no longer dead-ends on a hard failure.
- Pure `src/lib/wedge-cold.ts` — `classifyWedgeFailure(message)` → cold (gateway unconfigured/capped) / transient (network/timeout/5xx/429) / other (keeps the real message, framed calmly); `isGatewayColdError`. 8 tests.
- `WedgeTeardown.tsx` — `onError` now sets a classified `failure` state → a calm inline `role=alert` banner (rose only for `other`) with honest guidance + the form preserved for retry, instead of a raw `toast.error`.

**Gate:** tsc 0 · `bun test` 1459/1459 (8 new). **Review:** ts + security — security CLEAN (no ReDoS, no NEW info-leak vs the prior toast, no XSS). TS folded 1 MEDIUM (a 429 rate-limit was misclassed cold → moved to transient + softened the note).

**Status ◐ [~85%], done on the board:** all 3 substantive CORE-UX-FELT fixes shipped (brief-stakes + Today-declutter cycle 9; cold-gateway now); the only remainder (de-jargon LoopStations marginal + govern lane-1) is not a clean autonomous slice.

---

## 2026-06-24 — Cycle 13: CORE-UX-TRUST ◐ — visible rejection-learning at the point of decision (v11 #10)

**Pick:** untouched `⬜` exhausted (all gated/parked/lane-1) → shifted to class-2 `◐`, lowest Rank. CORE-UX-TRUST #10's buildable remainder = visible rejection-learning (auto-clear gates = chokepoint `ai/loop.server.ts` + founder-gated). Lane 1 on REPO-DECLUTTER (incl. the dashboard in its globs).

**Built:** make the user's rejections visible + registered at the point of decision.
- Pure `src/lib/rejection-learning.ts` — `summarizeRejections` tallies the caller's REJECTED decided rows per (agent, tool) (count + latest reason, NUL-keyed); `rejectionCountFor` / `rejectionPatternCount`. 6 tests.
- `governance.functions.ts` — `listGovernApprovals` derives `rejectionsByKey` from the SAME RLS-scoped decided-history fetch that feeds the track record (no extra query).
- `ApprovalsPanel.tsx` — a quiet "declined N× before" chip on a pending gate the caller has rejected before.

**Gate:** tsc 0 · `bun test` 1452/1452 (6 new). **Review:** ts + security — security CLEAN (tenant-isolation; the decline reason is computed but never rendered, only the count). TS folded 1 HIGH (inner `rows` shadowed the outer pending-approval `rows` → `histRows`).

**Status `◐ [~75%]`, `done` on the board:** track record (cycle 9) + rejection-learning shipped; the only remainder (auto-clear/suppress gates) is chokepoint + founder-gated → no autonomous slice left.

## 2026-06-24 — Cycle 12: DEF-04 ◐ — design readiness from a spec (the deterministic half) (v11 #27)

**Founder steers now STANDING (in memory + docs):**
1. **Build the ranked board top-down; decide IA/design yourself** — park ONLY what needs the founder's specific input or is chokepoint-pinned (`ai/*`). (memory `build-dont-overpark`)
2. **Whole-register coverage + class-of-work order** (AGENTS.md §3): don't stop at the v11 front; class order = untouched `⬜` FIRST → partial `◐` SECOND (top-down) → pure design THIRD. Halt ONLY on a genuine founder-creative/strategic call or a secret I don't hold. A UI I can't visually verify is NOT a halt.
3. **Compact AFTER each completed cycle, NEVER mid-cycle** — via ScheduleWakeup a fresh turn, then continue.
4. **NO BLOCKCHAIN anywhere now** (memory `no-blockchain-trust-integrity` + session-decisions): integrity-type features = a plain SHA-256 fingerprint for EVERY user, NOT enterprise, NOT blockchain; signing/persistence deferred OPTIONAL. Don't reintroduce blockchain/enterprise framing.

**NEXT PICKS (top-down, class order):** untouched `⬜` is nearly EXHAUSTED on the autonomous front. Remaining untouched ⬜ all blocked/parked: **#15 ORCH-DELEGATE** (Linear key + BLD-04), **#20 POS-V11 / #21 LANDING-PAGE-V11** (founder-voice copy), **#28 REPO-DECLUTTER-V11** (its named target `feature-backlog.md` is still referenced as LIVE in CLAUDE.md/dashboard — archiving it is a contested doc-architecture call; only archive UNAMBIGUOUSLY-dead docs, or ask the founder). Lane 1 took **#25 DELEGATE-DESK ✅** + **#30 AGENT-FLEET-VIEW** (in dev). **So the next cycle likely shifts to class 2 — buildable `◐` partials, top-down:** **CORE-UX-TRUST #10** (visible rejection-learning is buildable; auto-clear gates is founder-gated), **CORE-UX-FELT #11** (cold-gateway hardening in WedgeTeardown ONLY — its de-jargon-govern.tsx half COLLIDES with lane-1 IA-DEPTH on govern.tsx), **INTEROP #16** (read surface done; outward WRITE/A2A is founder-gated). BRAIN-UX #8 + DBR #22 remainders are chokepoint/AI-lane. Use `bash scripts/lane.sh next` + reap each cycle; check lane-1 claims (`lane.sh list`) before picking.

---

## 2026-06-24 — Cycle 12: DEF-04 ◐ — design readiness from a spec (the deterministic half) (v11 #27)

**Pick:** lowest-rank UNTOUCHED `⬜` with a clean autonomous slice. DEF-04's headline (generated mockup + sandbox preview) needs the AI chokepoint / gated SANDBOX — built the deterministic half instead. Skipped: ORCH #15 (Linear key), POS/LANDING (founder copy), REPO-DECLUTTER #28 (contested-live target doc). Lane 1 had AGENT-FLEET-VIEW #30.

**Built:** a design-readiness check that turns a PRD spec into a design brief.
- Pure `src/lib/design-readiness.ts` — `analyzeDesignReadiness(body)` scans the spec for the 8 things design needs named (states, edge cases, a11y, responsive, copy, permissions, data, flow) → score + level + per-dimension checks; `readinessGaps`; `normalize` strips markdown. Deterministic, no AI/key/DB. 6 tests.
- `src/components/product/DesignReadinessPanel.tsx` — a calm "Design readiness · N/8 · level" bar + the gaps to close, on the PRD page (client-side on the loaded body; silent when empty).

**Gate:** tsc 0 · `bun test` 1437/1437 (6 new). **Review:** ts + security reviewers — both CLEAN (regexes ReDoS-safe, no XSS since the body is only scanned not rendered, math/keys/guards correct). Fixed an inaccurate test comment.

**Status `◐`:** the spec linter / design brief is shipped for every PRD; the gated remainder is the generative half (AI mockup = a pinned-chokepoint CallSurface; live preview = the SANDBOX provider) — named on the panel.

## 2026-06-24 — Cycle 11: TRUST-VERIFY ◐ — a normal "Integrity check" for the Trust Ledger (all users, NOT blockchain)

**Pick:** lowest-rank UNTOUCHED `⬜` item buildable without founder input. Skipped: ORCH-DELEGATE #15 (Linear API key + BLD-04 gated), POS #20 / LANDING #21 (founder-voice copy), DELEGATE-DESK #25 (new-surface-vs-Missions product-IA call). DBR(H1) #22 is `◐` (deferred under class order). CONNECTORS-V11 #14 shipped by lane 1.

**Built:** a plain integrity check over the Trust Ledger — a SHA-256 FINGERPRINT (a checksum, NOT a blockchain), available to every user.
- Pure `src/lib/trust-verify.ts` — canonicalize (integrity-relevant fields only) + hash chain (`sealReceipts` head = fingerprint, total order) + `verifyReceipts` (detect/pinpoint tamper) + `shortHead`; Web Crypto; 13 tests.
- `trust-ledger.functions.ts` — shared `loadReceipts` (listTrustReceipts preserved) + `getLedgerSeal` + `verifyLedgerSeal` (head = exactly 64 hex; RLS-scoped).
- `_authenticated.trust-ledger.tsx` — calm `SealPanel` ("Integrity check · fingerprint · N records", Copy fingerprint, paste-to-verify Unchanged/Changed; hidden on an empty ledger).

**Founder steer mid-build (now standing rule #4 above):** NO blockchain; not enterprise-only; keep it normal. **Reframed** all copy/comments away from "tamper-evident/blockchain/regulated-buyer/enterprise" → "Integrity check, all users"; signing + persistence stay deferred OPTIONAL. Kept (not reverted) since the built checksum is harmless + useful.

**Gate:** tsc 0 · `bun test` 1411/1411 (13 new). **Review:** 4-lens adversarial Workflow (crypto-soundness, tamper-completeness, security/RLS, TS+behavior) — chain SOUND, detection COMPLETE, behavior+import CLEAN. Folded: empty-ledger `count===0` guard, total-order tie-break, 64-hex head validator, head-only-path docs. Won't-fix (rationale): co-tenant workspaceId + no-rate-limit = identical to the existing listTrustReceipts surface, RLS is the gate.

**Status `◐`:** autonomous slice (fingerprint + verify + surface, all users) shipped; deferred OPTIONAL = Ed25519 signature + write-time persistence (lights up per-record pinpointing). Per founder ruling these stay optional, never blockchain/enterprise.

## 2026-06-24 — Cycle 10: STITCH-LOOP ✅ — one felt loop across the surfaces (v11 #9)

**Pick:** lowest-Rank fully-open buildable item. #8 BRAIN-UX `◐` parked (remainder = the AI open-analyst ceiling, chokepoint-gated). Lane 1 held IA-NAV-V11 (#12) — avoided.

**Built:** a calm "loop position" strip that makes the engine's one continuous loop FELT across the surfaces (fixes the v11 "feels fragmented" perception), WITHOUT touching `AppShell`/`nav-model` (lane 1's IA-NAV territory).
- **Pure model** `src/lib/loop-surfaces.ts` — the 7 loop surfaces in order (Today → Product → PRD → Build → Missions → Brain → Trust), each with its forward `produces` payload; `loopIndexForPath` (longest-prefix; `/` exact-only), `isLoopSurface`, cyclic `loopNeighbors` (Trust→Today wraps). Type derived from the `as const` array so `to` stays a literal route union (TanStack `<Link>` validates routes at compile time). 10 tests.
- **Component** `src/components/cadence/LoopThread.tsx` — route-derived (`useRouterState`), renders null off-loop, current emphasized, next in action-blue, handoff caption "{produces} → {next}", cyclic glyph. Calm chrome (Engine-Room doctrine).
- **Wiring** — one render in `TopBar` (covers 6 surfaces that mount it) + one on PRD detail (`prds.$id`, the lone loop surface without TopBar).

**Gate:** tsc 0 · `bun test` 1377/1377 (10 new). **Review:** TS + security agents — security clean (static-constant hrefs/titles; pathname only an index lookup); 2 TS nits folded (literal-route-union `to` restores compile-time validation; removed duplicate next-index). Pre-existing out-of-scope note from security: `prds.$id` line ~227 puts `github_issue_url` directly in an `href` — fine today (server-written), would be a `javascript:` risk if ever user-editable (→ KI).

**Status:** `✅` — defined scope (legible/felt loop across surfaces) delivered. Future enhancement (not unfinished scope): data-driven cross-surface handoffs (the actual opportunity → this PRD; contextual forward-CTAs).

**Doc-loop:** dashboard #9 → `✅` (top summary + register row) + tally; plan.md §4; this report; AGENTS.md §3 founder rule; KI for the github-href note. Committed, rebased, FF-pushed; claim released.

## 2026-06-24 — Cycle 9: CORE-UX-FELT ◐ — brief leads with stakes + the Today home declutter

**Founder steer this cycle:** stop over-parking #11-#21 — build the ranked board top-down and make the design/IA calls myself; park ONLY what needs the founder's specific input (saved to memory: `build-dont-overpark`). So I released TRUST-VERIFY (#26, no code written) and took **#11 CORE-UX-FELT** top-down. Mid-cycle the founder ALSO gave a specific UX ask: the Today home over-populates with the full approvals list — collapse it to one subtle bar that opens the detail. Folded that in (it IS CORE-UX-FELT) as the priority.

**Shipped (◐):**
- **Brief leads with STAKES not counts** — `ensureTodayBrief` folds pending gates into reversibility/blast-radius (pure `src/lib/copilot-brief.ts`, `summarizeGateStakes`/`describeStakes`, 7 tests) + a reframed prompt. The brief CALLS callModel but the change is the prompt/data, NOT the pinned runtime — so it's autonomously buildable.
- **FOUNDER ASK — Today declutter** — gate approvals collapsed into one calm `PendingApprovalsBar` (count + quiet high-stakes hint) → Govern → Approvals. Real PM decisions (spec/opp reviews) still lead as cards.
- **Track record relocated** — the CORE-UX-TRUST per-agent "approved 44/47" moved to `ApprovalsPanel` (its new point of decision); orphaned Today track query removed.

**Adversarial review (ts + security):** security clean. TS found 1 HIGH (brief gate query missing `.eq("user_id")` — could feed another user's gates into the brief) → **fixed + verified**.

**Gate:** tsc 0 · **1346 full suite** · no migration · no chokepoint. Docs: dashboard #11 + top-summary, `plan.md` §4.

**Remaining (◐, autonomous, next):** cold-gateway first-run hardening (`WedgeTeardown`) + de-jargon `LoopStations`/`govern`.

**State:** committed + FF-pushed; claim released as ◐. (Founder ruling this session: compact AFTER each completed cycle, then continue — done here.)

---

## 2026-06-24 — Cycle 8: INTEROP-V11 ◐ — MCP read surface repaired + completed

**Picked:** `INTEROP-V11` (#16, ◐). Lane 1 was on PLAYBOOK-REGISTRY (#17, claimed 4 min before) + the chokepoint pin held `ai/*` — no MCP overlap. Claimed #16 atomically + pushed the `🔨 In Dev` dashboard claim before code.

**Found (the cycle's headline):** building the named "roadmap/spec read tools," a live-schema audit via the Lovable MCP found **3 existing MCP read tools broken by schema drift** — `search_signals` (`summary`→`content`, dead `products` embed), `search_opportunities` (`predicted_ice`/`roadmap_status`→`ice_score`/`roadmap_bucket`), `get_prd` (table `prd`→`prds`, dead cols→`body_md`). Each would error against prod on first external call. Logged KI-40.

**Shipped (◐ — read surface now correct + complete):**
- **Repaired** all 3 drifted tools against the verified prod schema.
- **Added** `search_prds` (keyword/status spec discovery) + `get_roadmap` (now/next/later/unbucketed via pure `groupByRoadmapBucket`, ICE-desc). Catalog 6 → **8 tools**.
- **Hardened** every search tool with `sanitizeIlikeQuery` vs PostgREST `.or()` filter-injection; ICE floor skips at `min_ice=0` so unscored opps aren't dropped.

**Adversarial review (ts + security):** security — tenant isolation **clean** (workspace_id sole boundary, present everywhere, no cross-tenant leak); fixed the pre-existing `.or()` injection it flagged. TS — no remaining drift; fixed `groupByRoadmapBucket` non-string throw + NULL-ICE silent-drop. Regression-guarded.

**Gate:** tsc 0 · **1318 full suite** · no migration · no chokepoint. Docs: `q1-mcp.md`, `known-issues.md` (KI-40), dashboard row #16 + top-summary #16, `plan.md` §4.

**Remaining (◐, founder-gated):** the outward WRITE/A2A scoped-token surface (scopes + audit).

**State:** committed + FF-pushed to `origin/main`; claim released as ◐.

---

## 2026-06-24 — Cycle 7: CORE-UX-TRUST ◐ — per-agent track record at the point of decision

**Triage first:** `lane.sh next` rank 1 was #9 STITCH-LOOP — but its value lives in the "felt"/UX-design layer (own Why: "at the UX layer") + it touches the global shell, i.e. the design pass the founder DEFERRED to a founder-prompted pre-launch stage, and it belongs with the coordinated IA/design cycle (#11/#12/#14). Parked it (not a thin model-only ship) and took the next strong, non-design, autonomous capability core. (#18 PM-IMPACT-LEDGER had been closed ✅ by lane 1.)

**Picked:** `CORE-UX-TRUST` (#10). Claimed atomically for lane 2 + pushed the `🔨 In Dev` dashboard claim BEFORE any code.

**Shipped (◐ — the data core):** the per-agent TRACK RECORD inline on the Today `DecisionCard` — "Scout · approved 44/47", so trust lives at the point of decision (the v11 core-user fix for the babysitting tax). `getNeedsYou` returns `trackByAgent` from the caller's own decided `agent_approvals`; new pure `src/lib/agent-track-record.ts` (`summarizeAgentRecords`/`formatTrackRecord`/`trackRecordsToObject`, **10 tests**). Honest by construction: approved = approved+executed+failed (a failed execution was still a human yes); rollbacks NOT fabricated.

**Adversarial review (ts + security):** security **clean** (user_id + RLS double-fence, parameterized `.in()`, React-escaped, no new exposure). TS reviewer found 1 real defect — `failed`-execution gates (human-approved) silently dropped, understating the record — **fixed** (count as approved) + regression-guarded; the limit-1000 ceiling documented as benign.

**Gate:** tsc 0 · **1300 full suite** · no migration · no chokepoint. Docs: dashboard row #10 + top-summary #10, `plan.md` §4.

**Remaining (◐, parked to founder):** auto-clear reversible tool gates (agent gating-behavior change) + visible rejection-learning.

**State:** committed + FF-pushed to `origin/main`; claim released as ◐.

---

## 2026-06-24 — Cycle 6: BRAIN-UX-V11 ◐ — per-decision "why" + "what's unresolved" lenses

**Picked:** `BRAIN-UX-V11` (#8, `lane.sh next` rank 1; lane 1 held no claim). Claimed atomically for lane 2 + pushed the dashboard `🔨 In Dev` claim BEFORE any code (anti-duplication doctrine).

**Pre-cycle hygiene:** the working tree carried a pure Prettier reformat of 11 files (a format-on-save; `git diff --ignore-all-space` showed zero logic). Per the founder velocity ruling (batch lint/prettier to a pre-launch stage, never mid-build) I **discarded** it rather than ship a 439-line churn commit that would also collide with lane 1 on rebase.

**Shipped (◐ → only the AI ceiling remains):** the two named rule-based remainder lenses for the Brain Insights tab.
- **Why we believe this** — `getBrainInsights` returns each recent decision's `rationale` + `revisedBy` (the title that replaced it). Per-decision plain-language "why".
- **What is unresolved** — an `unresolved` lens: active `contradicts` pairs touching a decision that no `supersedes` settled, + mixed outcomes; honest empty state.
- Pure helpers `supersedingIdFor` / `supersedesParentMap` / `resolvedChildIds` / `activeContradictions` / `deriveUnresolved` (`src/lib/brain-insights.functions.ts`); UI `InsightsPanel.tsx`. 11 floor + 11 new = **22 tests**.

**Adversarial review (ts + security):** security **clean** (RLS-scoped, no new sink, no cross-tenant path). TS reviewer found **2 real defects, both fixed + regression-guarded:** (1) `revisedBy` was drawing from the shared `supersededChildIds` (which lumps `contradicts` with `supersedes`), so a mere conflict read "now superseded by X" and could show as both revised AND unresolved — fixed with a `supersedes`-ONLY map keeping the two states disjoint; (2) the unresolved `count` under-counted when the list cap fired — now the honest pre-cap total.

**Gate:** tsc 0 · **1278 full suite** · no migration · no chokepoint. Docs: `brain-insights.md`, dashboard row #8 + top-summary #8, `plan.md` §4.

**State:** committed + FF-pushed to `origin/main`; claim **released** as ◐ (the AI open-analyst ceiling is the only remaining slice, chokepoint-gated → founder).

---

## 2026-06-22 — DBR-3f: shared-premise precedent (DBR multi-hop, graph-over-vectors)

**Picked:** `DBR (H1)` (`lane.sh next` rank 3; ranks 1-2 WM-M15/WM-M9 are chokepoint-pinned / attended → skipped inline). Claimed the register row atomically and **held** it for the increment.

**Shipped (◐ dormant-correct):** the multi-hop graph-over-vectors query the decision-brain evidence table names but had never been built — "what happened the last time a decision rested on the SAME upstream premise as this one?" Walks the DERIVATION graph UP to the decision's premise ancestors, then back DOWN to their other descendants (cousins sharing a premise off the target's own path), and reports each cousin PRD's recorded outcome (missed-first). Distinct from DBR-2/3, which walk the supersedes/contradicts reversal edges.

- New PURE `src/lib/ai/shared-premise.ts` (two-directional walk + outcome-ranked selection + Critic block; 21 tests incl. a depth-complete subtree-exclusion regression).
- New `src/lib/ai/shared-premise.server.ts` (two bounded, fail-safe BFS closures via one column-parameterized helper + a `prds.outcome` join).
- Wired an independent fail-safe `sharedPremise` block + guidance into `runCritic` (`src/lib/ai/critic.server.ts`).

**Adversarial review:** 3-lens Workflow (correctness / runtime-safety / over-claim) = **unanimous SHIP, 0 blockers, 0 must-fix.** Folded 3 cheap real improvements: depth-complete subtree exclusion; honesty-softened block framing; symmetric `.limit` on the outcomes query. Tenancy proven clean (user_id-filtered closures; RLS-scoped `prds` read; UUID-gated ids).

**Gate:** tsc 0 / 21 shared-premise tests / **1102 full suite** / no em/en-dash in generated strings. Byte-identical + fail-safe until derivation edges + recorded outcomes both exist.

**State:** committed + fast-forward pushed to `origin/main`. `DBR (H1)` claim **HELD** (heartbeat) for the next increment (next: extend the same resolver to the proactive precedent nudge, mirroring DBR-3b's Critic → nudge fan-out). Docs: `decision-brain.md` (DBR-3f), dashboard row (Increment 8), `plan.md` §4.

## 2026-06-22 — DBR-3g: shared-premise precedent on the proactive nudge (Critic → nudge fan-out)

Second increment on the held DBR umbrella. Extended DBR-3f's resolver from the Critic to the PROACTIVE nudge ("value before you ask"), mirroring DBR-3b.

- Refactored `src/lib/ai/shared-premise.server.ts` → structured `resolveSharedPremiseItems` (the Critic formatter is now a thin wrapper, behavior-preserved).
- New `src/lib/shared-premise.functions.ts` (`getSharedPremisePrecedent`, RLS-scoped, fail-safe) + new `src/components/decision/SharedPremiseNudge.tsx` (mirror of PrecedentNudge; shows decisions built on the SAME upstream premise), mounted on `OpportunityDetail.tsx` + `_authenticated.prds.$id.tsx`.
- Extended the held DBR ledger claim's globs to cover the new + touched files (cross-lane reservation).

**Review:** focused code-review (feature-dev:code-reviewer) = **SHIP_WITH_FIXES** — refactor confirmed behavior-preserving, RLS clean, dormant-safe; folded both must-fixes (null-summary trailing-colon render; `enabled: !!targetId` guard).

**Gate:** tsc 0 / **1110 full suite** / no em/en-dash in UI copy. Renders nothing until derivation edges + outcomes exist.

**State:** committed + FF-pushed to `origin/main`. `DBR (H1)` claim still **HELD**. IA note: three decision asides now stack on these surfaces (precedent / shared-premise / currency) — flagged as a candidate for the founder-prompted IA-consolidation pass.

## 2026-06-22 — DBR-3h: name the shared premise (felt-voice completion)

Third increment on the held DBR umbrella. The shared-premise precedent now names WHICH premise two decisions share ("the same opportunity 'Mobile checkout revamp'") instead of "the same ground".

- `collectSharedPremiseCousins` additively tracks premise provenance (a `seedOf` map; BFS first-reach from all ancestors = the closest common ancestor / LCA → the most-specific shared premise). Existing DBR-3f tests stayed green (additive fields).
- New fail-safe, `user_id`-scoped `attachPremiseTitles` resolves the premise title per kind; `formatSharedPremisePrecedent` + `SharedPremiseNudge` name it, generic fallback when unresolved.

**Review:** focused code-review = **SHIP_WITH_FIXES** — LCA provenance confirmed correct + dormant-safe; folded both (defense-in-depth `user_id` on title queries; deterministic `ancestorKind` preferring the node's own `child_kind`).

**Gate:** tsc 0 / **1113 full suite** / +3 tests (24 in the file) / no em/en-dash. Byte-identical / generic phrasing until premise titles resolve.

**State:** committed + FF-pushed to `origin/main`. `DBR (H1)` claim still **HELD** (shared-premise feature now complete across Critic + nudge + named premise).

## 2026-06-22 — lane.sh slash-id fix (unblock claiming slash-named register items)

Before building, the claim of `M1 / LRN-01` returned a false `HELD`: the atomic mutex `mkdir "$CLAIMS/$id"` splits on the `/` into a nonexistent nested path, so it failed and was misread as "held" — every slash-named register item (`M1 / LRN-01`, `LCH-01 / L1`) was permanently unclaimable. Fix: one `_cdir()` helper replacing ONLY `/` (every existing id stays byte-identical), routed through all 7 CLAIMS/DONE path sites; logical id kept in `meta id=`. +2 regression tests (`scripts/lane.test.sh` 11/11, was 9/9). Committed + pushed. Files: `scripts/lane.sh`, `scripts/lane.test.sh`.

## 2026-06-22 — M1 / LRN-01: Support triage loop, increment 1 (autonomous core)

**Picked:** `M1 / LRN-01` (Support triage) — the founder's constraint this run was "untouched items only, start from zero, no AI chokepoint / Stripe / BYO keys." Of all 18 `⬜` rows it was the ONLY one not Gated/Deferred/chokepoint; the rerank put it at #2. Claimed the register row and **held** it for the increment.

**Shipped (◐ dormant-correct, never touches the AI chokepoint):** the loop "tickets → recurring clusters → Discover signals," server + engine only.
- `support_tickets` table (workspace-scoped, RLS via `is_workspace_member`; migration `20260622090000`, forward-only, applies on the founder's next publish).
- PURE `src/lib/support/triage.ts` — Unicode-aware tokenizer + **greedy-leader clustering against each cluster's common core** + signal-payload shaping (deterministic, 24 tests).
- `src/lib/support/draft.ts` — deterministic humanized template reply (works with no AI) + a dormant `DraftProvider` seam for the founder-gated AI layer (routes through an EXISTING `CallSurface` when wired; no new surface).
- `src/lib/support-triage.functions.ts` — add/bulk/list tickets, `runSupportTriage` (emits each recurring cluster as a `source='support-triage'` signal → feeds Discover), `listSupportClusters`, `draftSupportReply`.

**Adversarial review:** two reviewers (runtime-fatal + clustering-logic). Runtime: **no fatal bugs** — columns/RLS/call-shapes clean, verified against the LIVE DB (`signals` insert columns + FK/helper targets all exist; `support_tickets` correctly absent in prod = dormant). Logic: determinism exhaustively sound, but a **HIGH** false-positive — single-link union-find welds two unrelated themes via one broad "bridge" ticket. **Folded every real fix before commit:** greedy-leader-against-the-core (kills the bridge merge + a long-ticket false-negative), Unicode-folding tokenizer, hardened `clusterKey` (top-6, no collision); +5 regression tests.

**Gate:** tsc 0 / eslint 0 (5 files) / 33 support tests / **1146 full suite** / no em/en-dash in generated strings.

**State:** committed + FF-pushed to `origin/main` (`f42e383846..c476c27c95`). `M1 / LRN-01` is **`done`-marked** (◐): the autonomous core is complete and NO further autonomous slice remains — all three remainders need the founder (UI-surface PLACEMENT is a taste/IA call; inbound channel = connector OAuth + spend; AI-written draft = chokepoint + spend). Docs: `docs/features/m1-support-triage.md` (new), dashboard row (◐), `plan.md` §4, `session-decisions.md`.

**Board state after this cycle:** with the founder's constraint this run (untouched `⬜` only, no `◐` partials, no chokepoint / Stripe / BYO / input-needed), the autonomous pick-list went **dry** — `lane.sh next` returns only `DBR (H1)`, a `◐` PARTIAL. **Founder decision (2026-06-22): ALLOW `◐` partials** — the loop returns to its default (continue partials), still off chokepoint / Stripe / BYO / input-needed. Next cycle resumes the loop default starting with `DBR (H1)` (Decision Brain; shared-premise is complete, so the next slice is a NEW sub-area — e.g. dormant entity-resolution v1 / guardrail #4, compute-only, no chokepoint).

## 2026-06-22 — DBR (H1): entity-resolution v1 (guardrail #4)

**Picked:** `DBR (H1)` (the only eligible item; partials now allowed). Shared-premise is complete, so this is a NEW DBR sub-area. Claimed the register row + **held** it.

**Shipped (◐ compute-only/dormant, never touches the AI chokepoint):** a pure, deterministic entity-resolution module (`src/lib/ai/entity-resolution.ts`, 24 tests) that groups decision-graph nodes naming the SAME initiative under different titles into one canonical entity, so a later increment can collapse those fragments before the supersession / shared-premise / precedent walks run (guardrail #4 — "entity resolution early, or the graph fragments"). **Precision-first:** merges only on an exact normalized-key match (surface variants) OR an explicit declared alias (codename↔description when stated); the fuzzy inference case is the founder-gated AI layer.

**Adversarial review (false-merge hunt):** caught + folded **two HIGH false-merge bugs** before commit — an over-greedy noise list ("Story editor" merged with "Editor redesign") and an ASCII-only tokenizer ("結帳 API" merged with "付款 API" on "api") — plus an `entityId` over-claim (now content-addressed from title keys, documented re-resolve-don't-persist). +5 regression tests.

**Gate:** tsc 0 / eslint 0 (2 files) / 24 entity-resolution tests / **1184 full suite** / no em/en-dash.

**State:** committed + FF-pushed to `origin/main` (`ff7fc5c695..7549f9001b`). `DBR (H1)` claim **HELD** for the next DBR slice. ◐ compute-only. Docs: `docs/features/decision-brain.md` (DBR-ENTITY-RES + guardrail #4), `plan.md` §4, `session-decisions.md`.

## 2026-06-22 — DBR (H1): entity-resolution WIRING into the shared-premise walk (flag-gated OFF)

Continued the held DBR umbrella: wired v1 into the shared-premise walk so same-initiative nodes collapse onto one canonical id and the walk connects cousins across fragments the derivation edges miss. Extended the claim globs to `src/lib/ai/shared-premise**` (disjoint).

**Shipped (◐ flag-gated OFF `DBR_ENTITY_ALIASING`, never touches the AI chokepoint):**
- pure `canonicalNodeId` (`entity-resolution.ts`) — node id → smallest member REAL id (not a synthetic `ent:` key, so id lookups still resolve).
- pure `canonicalizeEdges` (`shared-premise.ts`) — rewrites edge ids through the canonical map, kinds untouched.
- server glue in `resolveSharedPremiseItems` (`shared-premise.server.ts`) — behind the flag, loads node titles (RLS-scoped, chunked) + collapses (target, ancestors, edges) before the cousin walk.

**Adversarial review = SOUND for ship (no fatal/high).** Byte-identical when off (flag block skipped, same object refs) and when nothing collapses. Folded two mediums: chunk the title `.in()` at `IN_BATCH=25` (an over-long IN would 414 → fail-safe silent no-op on large graphs); resolve collapse PER KIND (a node never merges onto its own same-titled derived artifact). The residual same-title false-merge is by-design and is what the founder's precision review must measure before flipping the flag.

**Gate:** tsc 0 / eslint 0 (5 files) / 26 entity-resolution + 27 shared-premise tests / **1189 full suite** / no em/en-dash. **State:** committed + FF-pushed (`57a363ab8b..38968679bf`). `DBR (H1)` RELEASED (◐; my entity-res/shared-premise arc complete — remaining DBR work is cross-lane or founder-gated).

## 2026-06-22 — SEC-INGEST-INJECTION: injection screening on the support-triage trust boundary (P0)

Released DBR (arc complete) and pivoted to a fresh, self-contained security item mined from `considerations.md` #3 (P0 — "the product's defining risk": untrusted input feeding agents). Support tickets are untrusted; the triage loop turns a cluster into a Discover signal that feeds agents — the exact boundary to screen.

**Shipped (◐, reuses existing infra, never touches the AI chokepoint, no schema change):** pure `src/lib/support/screening.ts` (`injectionScreenDecision` wrapping the battle-tested `classifyInjection`/`assessCorpusInjection`) wired into `runSupportTriage` at the signal-emission boundary — a structural attack QUARANTINES the cluster (never emitted; tickets stay open + re-screened), a lexical-only override is emitted but tagged `needs-review`, ALLOW is normal.

**Key correctness property (tested):** a genuine ticket merely QUOTING an injection is NOT over-quarantined — only a real structural attack is — so it hardens the path without dropping legitimate tickets. Proportionate self-review (small change reusing a thoroughly-tested pure classifier; no new columns; the screen is driven). +7 screening tests.

**Gate:** tsc 0 / eslint 0 (3 files) / 40 support tests / **1196 full suite** / no em/en-dash. **State:** committed + FF-pushed (`38968679bf..13981698ad`); `done`-marked. `considerations.md` #3 marked PARTIALLY ADDRESSED.

## 2026-06-22 — SEC-SIGNAL-INGEST-INJECTION: screen the LIVE signal-ingest webhook (P0)

The higher-value follow-up: the dormant support path was hardened last cycle; this hardens the LIVE, EXTERNAL door. The public `api/public/ingest-signals` webhook turns any external POST into `signals` rows (token-auth, service-role insert) — a real external attack surface.

**Shipped (◐, reuses existing infra, no schema change, no chokepoint):** new GENERIC `src/lib/ingest-guardrails.ts` (`screenIngestText`, reuses the structural-gate `classifyInjection`; domain-neutral so MCP/A2A ingest can reuse it) wired into the webhook — each item's full attacker-controlled free text (title + content + source) is screened BEFORE insert; a structural attack is REJECTED (never stored), a borderline one stored with a `needs-review` tag; the response gains a `quarantined` count.

**Focused adversarial review (external attack surface) = SOUND, no fatal/high/medium.** Confirmed: the screen is on the only insert path (no bypass), the empty-rows guard is safe (rate limit charged per-request before screening, so all-quarantine floods stay metered), `tags:[]`→`'{}'` is valid, and the classifier is ReDoS-safe (bounded quantifiers + 20k cap, 50×5000 char ceiling). **Folded the one LOW finding:** the `source` field reaches the reactor's agent-visible event payload, so it is now part of the screened text.

**Gate:** tsc 0 / eslint 0 (3 files) / 5 ingest-guardrails tests / **1201 full suite** / no em/en-dash. **State:** committed + FF-pushed (`d262f521f5..9c576c3390`); `done`-marked (webhook scope complete; live-verify on publish; external MCP/A2A screen is the remaining third class). `considerations.md` #3 updated.

---

## ▶ SESSION CLOSED — 2026-06-22 night (founder: "pick up tomorrow")

Founder paused the autonomous run. **Everything committed + fast-forward pushed to `origin/main`; tree clean, 0 ahead/0 behind; no ledger claims held** (DBR released, both SEC items done-marked). To resume: re-invoke `/overnight-build`.

**This session shipped 7 commits to `main`** (all gate-green + adversarially reviewed + documented): the `lane.sh` slash-id harness fix; M1 Support-triage core; DBR entity-resolution v1; the entity-resolution → shared-premise wiring (flag-gated OFF); and two P0 injection screens (support-triage boundary + the live signal-ingest webhook) — which together close considerations #3 for every non-chokepoint path. Suite grew **1113 → 1201** tests. Never touched the AI chokepoint / Stripe / BYO.

**WHY HOLDED:** the clean autonomous backlog within the founder's constraints (no chokepoint / Stripe / BYO / input-needed) is verifiably exhausted — the board's only eligible row (`DBR (H1)`) has only cross-lane (Lane 1's files) or founder-gated work left; the last injection surface (MCP/A2A) is in the chokepoint.

**WHERE TO PICK UP (founder-gated, the founder's call):** (a) flip `DBR_ENTITY_ALIASING` after a precision review on real data; (b) connect a support inbound channel + make the M1 `/support` UI-placement call; (c) decide on chokepoint work (MCP/A2A screen, WM-M9) and/or cross-lane DBR wiring; (d) the queued founder activations (Stripe go-live, `credits_enabled()`/`AI_COST_ROUTING`, `DECISION_BRAIN_SUPERSESSION`); (e) the one-time §14 design pass when the product is final. Canonical pickup note: `SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md` §0 (the SESSION CLOSED note at the top); full per-commit detail: `plan.md` §4 (2026-06-22 entries).

## ▶ SESSION RESUMED — 2026-06-24 (continuous lane loop, autonomous)

### Cycle 1 · EVENT-REACTOR-LIVE (#2) → ◐ verified-built + retired (`done`)

Claimed EVENT-REACTOR-LIVE (lane 2); TEST-SEED (#1) skipped (held by lane 1). **Finding (live-audited via Lovable MCP vs prod `371dd588…`): the reactor is NOT unbuilt — it is already wired + scheduled end to end.** Emit = 3 `*_reactor_fanout` triggers + 12 enabled default subscriptions (path-agnostic `AFTER INSERT`, so every write path already fans out — no non-redundant TS emit to add). Consume = `event-reactor-tick` pg_cron, `active`, `* * * * *`, with KI-27/28 hardening in-handler. It is cold only for INPUT volume (`event_queue` = 1 all-time row, an `opportunity.scored`/`confirm` event correctly awaiting an operator) — a data gap owned by TEST-SEED/AMBIENT-SENSE, not a code gap.

**Prod gap surfaced → KI-38 (founder republish):** live `event_queue` lacks `attempt_count`/`next_attempt_at` (`ki27_cols_present=0`), so KI-27's migration `20260620220500` was never applied to Lovable's DB despite KI-27 being marked RESOLVED (its note records only a `BEGIN..ROLLBACK` dry-run). The deployed consume-tick `.select`s those columns → any `auto` (`signal.created`) dispatch will error until a republish applies them.

**No clean migration-free, non-redundant CODE slice exists** for this row right now (trigger emit already covers everything; new event types need a blocked migration; republish is founder-gated). So: documented the verified architecture + gap in `f-agent-3-event-reactor.md`, logged KI-38, re-scoped the dashboard row ⬜→◐, and `lane.sh done`-retired it from the auto-picker. **No feature code shipped (correct: shipping redundant emit code would be dead code).** Remaining = (a) founder republish [KI-38, gated]; (b) new event types [migration, blocked while a migration lane holds the `supabase/migrations` prefix lock]; (c) live proof [overlaps LOOP-PROVE]. Gate: doc-only, tree clean. Next: pick the next ranked unclaimed item.

### Cycle 2 · TRUST-LEDGER (#6) → ✅ built + gate-green

Skipped #3 AMBIENT-SENSE (wire cluster-tick to scheduler = pg_cron migration, blocked by lane 1's migration lock), #4 AMBIENT-TRIGGER (new event types = migration + needs AMBIENT-SENSE), #5 LOOP-PROVE (needs lane 1's not-yet-landed TEST-SEED seed) — all readably blocked. Roamed to #6 TRUST-LEDGER, the highest-ranked migration-free strong build.

**Shipped (net-new, no schema change, no chokepoint):** `/trust-ledger` authenticated surface (sidebar Trust row) rendering every decision + decided autonomous action as a receipt — what/why/evidence/who-approved+when/standing-or-superseded — with kind+outcome+search filters. Server fn `listTrustReceipts` composes workspace-scoped `decisions` + `agent_approvals` + the bitemporal `artifact_lineage` graph (supersession via active `supersedes`/`contradicts` child edges; evidence counts; source-label hydration). Pure composition helpers unit-tested (14 tests).

**Adversarial review (ecc:typescript-reviewer) — 1 real bug folded + 2 hardening:** counts computed post-filter+limit (lied with a filter on) → now from the full kind+search scope; `summarizeAction` subject length-capped; `relTime` null-guarded. **Cleared via live Lovable-MCP check:** `decisions`/`agent_approvals`/`artifact_lineage` SELECT policies are all `is_workspace_member(...)` → no tenant leak from a caller-supplied `workspaceId`, cross-member supersession visible; `args`→title is render-escaped (no XSS).

**Route registration:** hand-added to `src/routeTree.gen.ts` (the TanStack generator runs only on dev/build, both RED in lane worktrees on the pre-existing Node-20/ESM lovable-tagger issue; Lovable regenerates on the next real build). **Gate:** tsc 0 / 1215 tests green. **State:** committed + FF-pushed; `done`-marked. Remaining (separate items): a "proven-right" outcome (LOOP-PROVE), richer render (DEMO-SEED-RICH), live-verify on publish. Files: `src/lib/trust-ledger.{functions,test}.ts`, `src/routes/_authenticated.trust-ledger.tsx`, `src/components/cadence/AppShell.tsx`, `src/routeTree.gen.ts`, `docs/features/trust-ledger.md`, dashboard, plan.

### Cycle 2b · EVENT-REACTOR-LIVE — live close (KI-38 resolved via Lovable MCP)

Founder published, then asked me to verify item #2 live. Found the publish did NOT apply the repo migrations (KI-27 columns still absent → confirms a Lovable publish deploys code but not `supabase/migrations/*.sql`). Under the founder's standing live-migration authority, **applied `20260620220500_ki27_reactor_reaper_retry.sql` to prod via the Lovable MCP** (idempotent DDL). Verified live: `attempt_count`+`next_attempt_at` present, status CHECK now includes `processing`, the lone pending `confirm` row intact, and the consume-tick's exact main query runs clean (was `42703` on `attempt_count`). The reactor's `auto` path is unblocked end-to-end. KI-38 → RESOLVED; `f-agent-3-event-reactor.md` prod-gap box updated; playbook §13 now documents the standing Lovable-MCP migrate+publish authority (founder ruling 2026-06-24). No git source change beyond docs (the migration file already existed).

### Cycle 3 · TRUST-SHARE (#7) → ✅ built + gate-green

Skipped #4 AMBIENT-TRIGGER (migration-blocked + depends on lane 1's in-progress AMBIENT-SENSE) and #5 LOOP-PROVE (verification largely done by TEST-SEED; live half coupled to the ambient loop). Built #7 TRUST-SHARE, the migration-free follow-on to TRUST-LEDGER.

**Shipped (reuses the decision viral loop; no schema change, no chokepoint):** (1) a Share affordance on the Trust Ledger decision cards (`ShareControl` → user-initiated `setDecisionShared` → copyable public `/d/$slug` link; RLS-owner-gated, no IDOR); (2) the public `/d/$slug` enriched into a receipt artifact rendering the honest Still-stands/Superseded outcome (computed server-side via admin, reusing the bitemporal `supersedingParentIds`; 7 unit tests).

**Adversarial security review (ecc:security-reviewer) + folded:** privacy hardening — the public page now reveals "Superseded" ONLY when the superseding decision is itself public (an `is_public` parent check), so a private override never leaks onto a public artifact. Cleared live: no id/PII leak from the admin-on-public-endpoint queries; `decisions` UPDATE RLS = `is_workspace_member AND user_id=auth.uid()` (IDOR-safe); fail-open → "Still stands". **Gate:** tsc 0 / 1221 tests green. **State:** committed + FF-pushed; `done`-marked. Live-verify on publish. Files: `src/lib/decisions-share.functions.ts`, `src/lib/trust-share.test.ts`, `src/routes/d.$slug.tsx`, `src/routes/_authenticated.trust-ledger.tsx`, `docs/features/trust-ledger.md`, dashboard, plan.

### Cycle 4 · BRAIN-UX-V11 floor (#8) → ◐ released

Skipped #5 LOOP-PROVE (lane-1-coupled verification). Built the BRAIN-UX FLOOR: a `/knowledge` **Insights** tab (now default) with rule-based human lenses — beliefs (standing/revised), what-we-learned + hit rate, a month timeline, and plain-language observations. `getBrainInsights` composes decisions+lineage+learnings (RLS-scoped, no migration/chokepoint); pure lens math + 11 unit tests, reusing the Trust Ledger's supersession rule. View `InsightsPanel.tsx`, Ember chrome, honest sparse states. **Gate:** tsc 0 / 1246 tests green. The AI "open analyst" ceiling is chokepoint-gated (follow-on); per-decision-why + unresolved lenses are more buildable floor. **State:** committed + FF-pushed; ◐ released (re-pickable). Files: `src/lib/brain-insights.{functions,test}.ts`, `src/components/knowledge/InsightsPanel.tsx`, `src/routes/_authenticated.knowledge.tsx`, `docs/features/brain-insights.md`, dashboard, plan.

### Cycle 4b · Live test — EVENT-REACTOR-LIVE (#2) + AMBIENT-SENSE (#3) (founder-requested)

App is published; founder asked to test #2 + #3 live. **EVENT-REACTOR-LIVE: ✅ PROVEN LIVE END-TO-END** — a controlled test signal inserted (Lovable MCP) into a subscribed workspace drove the whole self-initiating loop unattended within seconds: `signals_reactor_fanout` trigger → `signal.created`/auto/discovery-scout event → `event-reactor-tick` cron claimed it (`processing`) + dispatched a mission + agent run, zero column errors (KI-38 fix confirmed in prod). Cleaned up every test artifact (signal, mission, run, event); baseline restored (event_queue back to 1, 0 orphans). **AMBIENT-SENSE: code deployed + workspaces primed (3 sense-on, 2 cluster-on, 27 signals tagged/clustered) but `sense-tick`/`cluster-tick` are NOT scheduled (never run) → logged KI-39.** Diagnosed the reactor's coldness: existing signals predate the trigger (≤2026-06-03) or sit in unsubscribed workspaces, so they generate no events — not a bug; the reactor is ready and starved for input. Activating the sense/cluster crons is founder-gated (recurring AI spend). No code change (verification + KI-39 + report).

### Cycle 5 · INTEROP-V11 floor (#16) → ◐ released

Picked a strong, self-contained capability in the Interop lane (skipped the IA/UX-heavy #9-#14 as shared-surface/design-cycle work, LOOP-PROVE as verification proven live this session). Added a read-only `search_decisions` MCP tool exposing the decision brain (decisions + standing/superseded outcome, reusing the Trust Ledger supersession rule) to external agents — workspace-scoped + audited like the existing read tools. Catalog + dispatch + helper + 4 tests; updated the catalog-integrity tests (5→6 tools). **Gate:** tsc 0 / 1260 tests green. ◐ released — remaining: roadmap/spec read tools + founder-gated WRITE/A2A. Files: `mcp.functions.ts`, `mcp-protocol.ts`, `api/mcp.ts`, `mcp-decisions.test.ts`, `mcp-protocol.test.ts`, `q1-mcp.md`, dashboard, plan.

### ▶ RESUME CURSOR — overnight run state (2026-06-24 ~06:00, after 9 cycles)

**FOUNDER STEERS THIS SESSION (apply going forward — also in memory `build-dont-overpark`):**
1. **Build the ranked board TOP-DOWN; stop over-parking.** Make the design/IA calls myself using the design-context docs. PARK ONLY what needs the founder's specific input (positioning/pricing WORDING, secrets, recurring-AI-spend activation, outward security-scope/audit) or is hard-blocked by the chokepoint pin (ai/* files). Design polish alone is NOT a reason to park.
2. **Compact AFTER each completed cycle (committed+pushed+docs-looped+released), NEVER mid-cycle, then continue without halt.** (Was: every 3 cycles.)

**Cycle 9 (this turn): CORE-UX-FELT (#11) ◐ —** the chief-of-staff brief now LEADS WITH STAKES not counts (pure `copilot-brief.ts`); **founder ask: the Today home no longer lists every gate approval — collapsed to one calm `PendingApprovalsBar` → Govern→Approvals**, where the per-agent track record (CORE-UX-TRUST) now lives; orphaned Today track query removed. tsc 0/1346; 1 HIGH (missing user_id scope on the brief gate query) fixed. **Remaining (◐): cold-gateway first-run hardening (`WedgeTeardown`) + de-jargon `LoopStations`/`govern`.**

**NEXT PICK (top-down, autonomous):** finish CORE-UX-FELT's remainder (cold-gateway + de-jargon) OR continue down the rank — **#12 IA-NAV-V11** (collapse nav to 5 + recessed Engine Room door; fully specified — BUILD it myself), **#13 SETTINGS-SEGREGATE** (5 groups named — execute), **#14 CONNECTORS-V11** (one connectors home). These are now BUILD targets, not parks. Then #20 POS-V11 (positioning WORDING = founder voice → park), #21 LANDING-PAGE-V11 (buildable from v11 canon). Lane 1 has been closing fast (PLAYBOOK/PM-IMPACT/STAKEHOLDER/EVALS done) — always `lane.sh reap` + check claims before picking.

### ▶ RESUME CURSOR — overnight run state (2026-06-24 ~05:00, after 8 cycles)

**Compaction-checkpoint update (cycles 6-8, this context):**
- Cycle 6: BRAIN-UX-V11 (#8) ◐ — added the per-decision "why" (rationale + revisedBy) + "what's unresolved" (open contradictions + mixed) lenses; revised-vs-contested kept disjoint; 22 tests. Only the AI ceiling remains (gated).
- Cycle 7: CORE-UX-TRUST (#10) ◐ — per-agent track record ("approved 44/47") inline on the Today DecisionCard; honest (failed-exec=yes, no fabricated rollbacks); 10 tests. Auto-clear-gates + rejection-learning halves stay founder-gated. (Parked #9 STITCH-LOOP = deferred UX/felt-design layer → the founder-prompted design cycle.)
- Cycle 8: INTEROP-V11 (#16) ◐ — **a live-schema audit (Lovable MCP) found 3 existing MCP read tools broken by schema drift (KI-40); repaired all 3 + added `search_prds`/`get_roadmap` + hardened `.or()` injection.** 8 MCP tools.
- **Published via Lovable MCP at the 3-cycle mark:** `get_project` confirms `latest_commit_sha` = pushed HEAD, `status: ready`, `error: null`, `is_published: true`; app serves HTTP 200; INTEROP fix data-verified live. No migration needed (all 3 cycles code-only).
- All committed + FF-pushed (0/0). Lane 1 closed #5 LOOP-PROVE, #17 PLAYBOOK-REGISTRY, #18 PM-IMPACT-LEDGER, #19 STAKEHOLDER-PACK, #3 AMBIENT-SENSE, #4 AMBIENT-TRIGGER, #1 TEST-SEED.

**Remaining open by rank (next picks):** #11 CORE-UX-FELT (chokepoint AI brief + design → park), #12 IA-NAV / #13 SETTINGS-SEGREGATE / #14 CONNECTORS (IA/design-layer → the deferred founder-prompted design cycle), #15 ORCH-DELEGATE (touches the chokepoint-pinned `registry.server.ts` → blocked), #20 POS-V11 (positioning docs = founder voice), #21 LANDING-PAGE-V11 (showcase, design, sequenced last), #22 DBR(H1) (cross-lane/founder-gated). **Most of the remaining board is now genuinely design/founder/chokepoint-gated — verify each before building; prefer any clean data/capability core.**

### ▶ RESUME CURSOR — overnight run state (2026-06-24 ~04:00, after 5 cycles)

**Lane 2 shipped this run (all committed + FF-pushed to origin/main, gate-green tsc+tests):**
1. EVENT-REACTOR-LIVE (#2) ◐ — verified the reactor pipeline is wired+scheduled live; **applied KI-27 migration to prod via Lovable MCP (KI-38 resolved)**; **proven live end-to-end** (test signal → trigger → event → cron → mission, cleaned up).
2. TRUST-LEDGER (#6) ✅ — `/trust-ledger` receipts surface (decisions+approvals+supersession); public path verified live.
3. TRUST-SHARE (#7) ✅ — public `/d/$slug` receipt + Share affordance; privacy-hardened (private overrides never leak).
4. BRAIN-UX-V11 (#8) ◐ — `/knowledge` Insights tab (beliefs/learned+hitrate/timeline/observations); floor only, AI ceiling chokepoint-gated.
5. INTEROP-V11 (#16) ◐ — read-only `search_decisions` MCP tool (decision brain to external agents).

**Ops:** applied 1 migration via Lovable MCP; triggered 3 publishes via MCP; fixed the dashboard top-summary sync gap (now update BOTH register row + top #1-21 list every cycle).

**Founder-gated / open (do NOT close autonomously):** KI-39 (schedule sense/cluster crons = recurring AI spend); EVENT-REACTOR new event types (migration, was migration-locked); LOOP-PROVE (DBR-engine verification); the IA/UX-heavy #9-#14 (STITCH-LOOP, CORE-UX-TRUST/FELT, IA-NAV, SETTINGS-SEGREGATE, CONNECTORS) better as a coordinated/design cycle; INTEROP WRITE/A2A surface (scopes/audit founder call); the AI "open analyst" ceiling for BRAIN-UX (chokepoint).

**Next picks (autonomous, by rank):** continue BRAIN-UX floor (per-decision why + unresolved lenses) or other clean migration-free capability rows. Goal: close every autonomously-buildable item by morning.
