# v7 PRD: Cadence, the Agentic Product OS

> _Created: 2026-06-14 · Last updated: 2026-06-19_

> **What this is.** The product requirements document for Cadence at the v7 reset. It turns the v7 strategy canon into buildable scope: problem, personas, epics as user stories with acceptance criteria, priorities tied to the M-0 to M-D milestones, dependencies, and the success metrics that gate launch. It is held to one rule above all others: a requirement may claim only what the code already does or what this document explicitly asks us to build. Every line is marked Built, Partial, or Missing against `main` at commit `f515cfb` (2026-06-14).

## 1. Problem and context

### The PM firefighting tax

A product manager at a growing B2B SaaS company spends close to half their week on reactive work: triaging customer signals, chasing status, stitching context across tools, and re-deriving decisions the team already made and forgot. The org runs around 101 apps and loses about an hour a day to tool-switching. The judgment work that a PM is actually paid for, the call on what to build and why, gets squeezed into the gaps.

This is an operating-expense tax, not a tooling gap. The cost is paid in PM salary hours and in bad calls made under time pressure with the evidence scattered. The buyer who feels it most is the product leader who holds the headcount budget and watches it burn on synthesis instead of strategy.

### The closing whitespace

No vendor today owns the governed, closed-loop PM system with compounding memory. The edges are converging fast. Productboard Spark moves insights into PRDs with org memory. Atlassian Rovo pushes downstream execution at enterprise scale. Dovetail and Enterpret turn signal into action. ChatPRD ships PRD drafting inside Linear. Build and engineering agents (Devin, Cursor, Factory, Replit, v0) own the Build station but not the PM loop. The window to own the middle, the decision and memory layer that ties sense to ship to learn, is roughly 18 to 24 months and may be as short as 6 to 12 if a distribution-rich incumbent bundles it as a feature.

The market is also bifurcated, and the gap is the opportunity. The honest base rate is failure: Gartner expects 40% of agentic projects cancelled by 2027; MIT finds 95% of GenAI pilots do not scale; only 21% of firms (McKinsey) have mature agent governance. The winners are separated from the cancelled 40% by exactly Cadence's surface: grounding, governance, human-in-the-loop, reliability, and demonstrable return. The job is to be the system-of-record that keeps a PM team out of the 40%.

### Why now, and what is already real

The engine that this product needs is real in code, verified against `main`. The loop advances itself unattended via a deterministic, model-free cron sweep. Memory threads into each agent handoff and compounds shipped outcomes into a recallable store. Governance is honest: bounded retry, adaptive step budgets, an "executed unattended" audit, a decision-first Today card, and three proof metrics computed over real tables. The green path stages multi-file changes, opens a PR, reads CI, and gates the merge.

The gaps are specific and fixable, not a rewrite. A live orchestrator slug bug kills multi-agent missions at planning. Six migrations sit unapplied on the live database, most urgently the one that lets a real account be created at all. Connectors are OAuth-wired but not operational, so sensing is webhook-only in practice. New users default to "observing," which gates everything and makes the felt product the opposite of ambient. The shipped roster is four specialist agents plus the orchestrator, with Critic as an inline call, not the nineteen-agent mesh of the long-term map.

This PRD is the plan to close that last mile on real data. Per the market read, the last mile is the moat. Closing it is the highest-return work in front of us.

---

## 2. Goals and non-goals

### Goals

1. **Make a real account creatable and a real multi-agent mission survivable.** The loop must run end to end on a new user's real data without crashing. This is the precondition for everything else.
2. **Make the felt experience ambient and governed.** Reframe from "review everything" to "ambient watch, approve by exception," with a visible on-ramp that loosens gating as an agent demonstrates safety.
3. **Make the memory moat visible and measurable.** Surface "this learning moved these priorities" and instrument the metrics (acceptance rate, ritual retention, autonomy ratio, NDR, time-to-value) that prove the moat compounds.
4. **Open the product to other agents.** Ship an MCP server and a documented public API so external agents and the user's other tools integrate against the typed handoff contract.
5. **Monetize on memory persistence and outcomes, and grow through a shareable decision link.** Plan tiers, entitlements, and a public redacted decision card as the viral loop.
6. **Get a real new user to first value in under 10 minutes on their own data.**

### Non-goals (for this PRD horizon)

- **Full autonomy with no human in the loop.** The target is ambient and governed. The PM approves the calls only they should make. We do not claim or build "an AI that replaces the PM."
- **The nineteen-agent mesh.** Breadth beyond the five-face core loop (Planner, Designer, Marketer, Support, and the rest) is deferred until the loop closes on real data.
- **Build-your-own-agent marketplace.** We preserve the contract and ship the MCP/API surface, but defer a third-party agent marketplace.
- **Two heavy GTM motions in parallel.** P2 (PLG) leads; P1 (team) follows in overlap. No cold outbound, no "book a demo" gating, no enterprise pilots before the wedge proves out.
- **Asserting the >$150/mo team price as a decided number.** It is a hypothesis validated by retention proof, piloted as fixed-fee outcome contracts first.
- **Kanban roadmap and sprint planning.** The Kanban and sprint model is off-thesis for an Agentic OS. The legacy `/roadmap` route still exists but is mothballed and slated for removal; it is not the roadmap model going forward.

## 3. Personas

### P1 · Senior or founding PM at a 50 to 400 person B2B SaaS

The budget-owner buyer. A product leader (VP or Head of Product, or a founding PM wearing that hat) who holds operating-expense budget and feels the firefighting tax as a line on the P&L.

**Job to be done:** "Stop me drowning in signal triage, status, and synthesis. Help me make defensible calls fast, and keep the evidence-to-decision-to-outcome thread intact so the team never re-litigates a settled call."

Lands as a felt single-player tool, expands to the team. Buys on OpEx replacement framing, not a per-seat tool line. Slower cold-start; needs real return-on-investment proof before the team motion.

### P2 · Individual PM or prosumer

The bottoms-up, self-serve entry. An individual PM or product-minded builder who wants a sharp chief of staff for their own work without buying enterprise tooling.

**Job to be done:** "Give me a Chief of Staff for my own product work, today, on a credit card, that remembers what I decided and why and gets sharper the more I use it."

Acquired through PM communities, Product Hunt, and build-in-public. Lower ACV, higher volume. Churns if the memory is not sticky, which is why persistent memory is the paid pull.

### The agent-as-user

A first-class persona, not a metaphor. An external agent (the user's other tools, a partner's automation, or a future third-party integration) that reads and writes against Cadence through MCP and the public API.

**Job to be done:** "Let me query a team's decision and memory layer and hand work into their governed loop through a typed, documented contract, so I can act on their product context without a human relaying it."

The typed A2A handoff payload already exists internally. This persona makes "ecosystem-driven" true by exposing that contract outward. It is also the B2B2B fallback if the standalone window closes: embed Cadence's memory and decision layer inside another tool.

---

## 4. Requirements by epic

Each requirement is a user story with acceptance criteria, a priority tied to the milestone that delivers it (M-0 emergency unblock through M-D dual-user and scale), and dependencies. Priority labels: **P0** = launch-blocking for that milestone; **P1** = needed for the milestone to feel complete; **P2** = enhances but does not block. Status reflects `main` at `f515cfb`.

---

### Epic A · The felt entry and decision queue

The Chief of Staff entry point: a Today surface that brings the PM only the calls they should make, and a mission cockpit that shows the reversible work the loop ran on its own.

**A1 · Needs-You decision queue** · Priority P0 (M-A) · Status: **Built**

> As a PM, when I open Cadence I want one queue of the calls that need me (approval gates, PRDs in review, opportunities the Critic flagged) so I can clear my decisions in one place instead of hunting across tabs.

Acceptance criteria:

- The Today surface returns three call types in one round-trip: pending or expired approval gates (ordered by expiry, capped at 10), PRDs in `review` status with their Critic review, and opportunities whose Critic verdict is `revise` or `kill`.
- Each card shows enough to decide: for approvals, the model and estimated cost from the trace; for PRD and opportunity calls, the Critic annotation.
- Approving an approval card resolves it through `resolveApproval`. The cleared-calls ring increments on clear.
- "Not now" defers a card session-locally without losing it across the round-trip.
- Spend-today and the 7-day median gate-response latency are visible on the surface.

Dependencies: A4 (Critic annotations), governance approval store. Code: `src/lib/today.functions.ts` (`getNeedsYou`), `src/components/today/DecisionCard.tsx`.

**A2 · Cold-start on-ramp** · Priority P1 (M-A) · Status: **Built**

> As a brand-new user with no signals, opportunities, or PRDs yet, I want a guided on-ramp instead of an empty decision queue so I know what to do first.

Acceptance criteria:

- When signals, opportunities, and PRDs all read zero, the Today surface shows the cold-start on-ramp instead of the Needs-You queue.
- A seeded demo workspace never sees the cold state.

Dependencies: A1. Code: `getColdStart` in `today.functions.ts`, `ColdStartOnramp`.

**A3 · Mission cockpit with unattended-execution audit** · Priority P0 (M-A) · Status: **Built**

> As a PM, I want to watch a mission run, see which steps the loop executed on its own, and step in only when a step is gated, so I can trust the loop without babysitting it.

Acceptance criteria:

- The mission detail surface shows a hop timeline, a mission graph (steps as nodes, dependencies as edges), and per-hop thought, tool call, and final output with tool-consequence labels and reversibility badges.
- It polls every 4 seconds (2 seconds for live hops).
- Every auto-mode, side-effecting tool call is recorded as unattended in `tool_calls` and labelled "executed unattended" in the cockpit.
- A gate-status hop shows approve and reject inline and unblocks the run on decision.
- Any hop output can be captured as a decision record linked to its signal, opportunity, or PRD.
- A halted mission shows a Retry path that restarts from the original goal.

Dependencies: B1 (auto-advance), B2 (slug-bug fix to reach multi-step). Code: `src/routes/_authenticated.missions.$missionId.tsx`, `src/lib/missions.functions.ts`, `src/lib/orchestrator.functions.ts`, `src/lib/ai/mission-advance.server.ts`.

**A4 · Critic challenge on the call** · Priority P1 (M-B) · Status: **Partial**

> As a PM, I want every consequential call red-teamed before I make it, so I see the case against it, not just the case for.

Acceptance criteria (Built today):

- The Critic runs as an inline call (`runCritic`) over opportunities and PRDs and stores its verdict on the row's `critic_review` jsonb.
- Critic-flagged opportunities and PRDs surface in the Today queue with the verdict.

Acceptance criteria (Missing, required for M-B):

- Critic is promoted to a first-class step in the orchestrated loop (a DECIDE red-team hop), not only an inline call, so "every call is challenged" holds inside missions, not just on standalone rows.

Dependencies: B2 (orchestrated loop must run). Code today: `src/lib/discovery.functions.ts` (lines 25, 62, 90). Note: Critic is not a seeded agent; the `critic` slug is a display face only.

---

### Epic B · The ambient and governed loop

The engine: the loop advances itself under governance, with a visible trust arc that loosens gating as agents prove safe.

**B0 · Fix the orchestrator slug bug** · Priority P0 (M-0) · Status: **Missing (live mission-killer)**

> As any user, when I dispatch a multi-agent mission I want it to plan and run instead of dying at the planning step.

Acceptance criteria:

- The orchestrator's stored system prompt enumerates only seeded slugs (`discovery-scout`, `strategist`, `prd-writer`, `builder`), or `mission.plan` validation aliases legacy names (`discovery`, `growth`, `analyst`) to real slugs.
- A multi-agent mission with a sensing step plans and dispatches without `mission.plan` throwing `references unknown slug`.

Dependencies: none. This gates the entire loop and ships before anything else. Code: `src/lib/ai/tools/orchestrator.server.ts` (line 177 throws today).

**B1 · Deterministic auto-advance** · Priority P0 (M-0) · Status: **Built**

> As a PM, I want the loop to carry a multi-wave mission forward on its own, between my visits, without me pushing each step.

Acceptance criteria:

- `advanceMissionCore` runs every minute via the `resume-runs` cron, model-free, claim-first compare-and-swap.
- Multi-wave missions advance past wave 0 (reflect, dispatch-ready, finalize) unattended.
- An operator can still push a mission forward manually with `advanceMission`.
- The sweep is capped per tick (currently 20 missions, oldest-untouched first; raise or shard when concurrency approaches the cap, KI-16).

Dependencies: B0 (so multi-agent missions reach the advance path). Code: `src/lib/ai/mission-advance.server.ts`, `resume-runs.ts`.

**B2 · Bounded retry and adaptive budget** · Priority P1 (M-A) · Status: **Built**

> As a PM, I want a stuck or failing step to retry within a bound and respect a step budget, so a mission neither stalls silently nor burns unbounded cost.

Acceptance criteria:

- The agent loop applies bounded retry and adaptive step budgets.
- Non-governance model errors set the run failed and the mission halted (no infinite `running`).

Dependencies: B1. Code: `src/lib/ai/loop.server.ts`. (Known residual: KI-15, a rare zero-step mission with an unconsumed handoff can sit `running`; cosmetic, no runaway work.)

**B3 · Visible trust arc and approve-by-exception defaults** · Priority P0 (M-A) · Status: **Partial**

> As a new user, I want the product to feel ambient (the loop runs reversible work, I approve the rest) with a visible on-ramp that earns more autonomy as the agents prove safe, not "gate everything from day one."

Acceptance criteria (Built today):

- A four-stage trust arc (observing, proving, trusted, ambient) is computed from mission success rate, approval acceptance rate, and mean eval score, stored in `agent_autonomy`.
- `resolveApprovalMode` is a safety floor: `ambient` makes everything auto, `trusted` promotes confirm to auto, `proving` promotes auto to confirm, `observing` makes everything review.

Acceptance criteria (Required for M-A, currently Missing or default-blocked):

- New accounts no longer feel "gate everything." Today the default is `observing` (every action, including auto-mode tools, becomes review), which structurally blocks unattended execution and pins the autonomy ratio near zero. M-A ships an honest, visible on-ramp (observing to proving to trusted) that loosens gating as the agent demonstrates safety.
- The Today queue presents two card types: "Waiting for your call" (approve or override) and "Executed and learned" (summary plus one-click undo). The green, executed-and-learned share grows as decisions roll forward without override.
- An override asks one question ("what's your reasoning?") that is stored as a memory signal (feeds Epic C).

Dependencies: B0, B1, C2 (override reasoning becomes memory). Code: `src/lib/ai/trust.server.ts` (line 194 defaults to `observing`), `src/lib/trust.functions.ts`.

**B4 · Webhook ingest and event reactor** · Priority P0 (M-0/M-A) · Status: **Partial**

> As a PM, I want a real source of signals to flow in and trigger the sensing path, so the loop has real data to work on.

Acceptance criteria (Built):

- An operator can rotate, revoke, and manage a 64-char ingest token (`ingest_tokens`).
- The public ingest endpoint accepts a Bearer token and inserts up to 50 signals per call.
- An event reactor maps `signal.created` to a target agent with an approval mode; auto-mode dispatches run via the cron tick, confirm-mode queues for approval.
- The auto-discovery path chains signal to Scout to scored opportunity to Strategist to PRD to Builder.

Gaps (required to operate on live):

- The `ingest_tokens` migration is committed but unapplied on live (KI-09); the endpoint 401s until synced.
- The endpoint has no rate limit (KI-10); a leaked token allows uncapped POSTs and fan-out cost. Add a per-token rate cap before scale.

Dependencies: M-0 migration sync. Code: `src/lib/ingest.functions.ts`, `src/lib/reactor.functions.ts`.

**B5 · Connector OAuth made operational** · Priority P1 (M-A) · Status: **Partial**

> As a PM, I want to connect my real sources (calendar, GitHub, and the rest) with a Connect button, so sensing is more than a webhook.

Acceptance criteria:

- The OAuth-only connector UI ships in Settings, Connected accounts (Built; founder ruling is Connect-button OAuth only, no key paste).
- Provider client-ID secrets are set and the GitHub App is registered, so connections and workspace bindings stop showing "setup pending" and actually connect (Missing; KI-12, KI-01).
- At least two ingest sources are real and feeding the loop by M-A exit.

Dependencies: founder OAuth-client registration and the six secrets; M-0 migration sync. Code: `src/lib/connectors/`. Until then, sensing is webhook-only and the env-var fallback keeps existing GitHub calls working.

**B6 · The green build path (stage, PR, CI, gated merge)** · Priority P1 (M-A/M-B) · Status: **Partial**

> As a PM, I want a work order to become staged code, a PR, a CI read, and a gated merge, so the loop reaches shippable output, not just a spec.

Acceptance criteria (Built):

- A work order (goal, optional PRD link, model) runs the Build agent loop, stages multi-file changes in `studio_changesets`, and exposes a pipeline journey strip from live DB fields.
- The session detail shows Changes, PR and CI, and Cost tabs; a steer mutation redirects mid-session.
- Changeset lifecycle is `staged`, `committed`, `pr_open`, `merged`, `abandoned`.

Gaps:

- The GitHub App is not yet registered (KI-12), so PR creation is non-operational on live and CI refresh is manual. The changeset tables gate on the same migration sync.

Dependencies: B5 (GitHub App registration), M-0 migration sync. Code: `src/lib/studio.functions.ts`, `src/routes/_authenticated.build.*`.

---

### Epic C · The compounding memory moat, made visible

The defensible layer: every validation, override, and outcome becomes a reasoning trace and evaluation no competitor has, and the product shows the PM that it is compounding.

**C1 · Outcome-to-memory compounding** · Priority P0 (M-B) · Status: **Built**

> As a PM, I want what shipped (or got killed) to teach the system, so my priorities re-score on evidence and I do not re-derive the same call.

Acceptance criteria:

- A completed mission or moved opportunity is distilled into a memory payload with verdict and summary and written to the memory store.
- The linked opportunity's ICE is re-scored (prior ICE to new ICE).
- Each dispatched hop recalls semantic memory into the handoff payload's `memory_refs`, rendered to the receiving agent.
- The Today surface shows the latest re-score as a "the loop closed" strip with the ICE delta visible.

Dependencies: B1, B2. Code: `src/lib/outcome.functions.ts`, `src/lib/ai/outcome-memory.ts`, `src/lib/ai/memory.server.ts`.

**C2 · Override reasoning captured as a memory signal** · Priority P1 (M-B) · Status: **Partial**

> As a PM, when I override an agent's call I want the system to ask why once and remember it, so my judgment compounds instead of evaporating.

Acceptance criteria (Built): outcomes and verdicts persist as memory the loop recalls.

Acceptance criteria (Missing, required for M-B): an override on a decision card prompts one "what's your reasoning?" question and stores the answer as a memory signal that future recalls surface. This is the same signal B3 references.

Dependencies: B3, C1. Code: extends `outcome.functions.ts` / `memory.server.ts`.

**C3 · Memory scope fix on the autonomous path** · Priority P0 (M-0) · Status: **Partial (fix committed, unapplied)**

> As a PM, I want the unattended loop to recall the full semantic memory, not only reflections, so the moat is real on the autonomous path, not just the interactive one.

Acceptance criteria:

- The memory-recall scope fix (`20260614091000`, a COALESCE change) is applied and verified on live, so the autonomous path recalls semantic memory, not only reflections.

Dependencies: M-0 migration sync. Status: committed in code, blocked on sync.

**C4 · The moat made measurable** · Priority P0 (M-B) · Status: **Partial**

> As a PM (and as a founder reporting to investors), I want to see that the memory is compounding (this learning moved these priorities) and trust the numbers behind it.

Acceptance criteria (Built): the "this learning moved these priorities" strip exists on Today; the three gauntlet metrics compute over real tables.

Acceptance criteria (required for M-B): instrument the scale-independent moat proof, outcome-accuracy lift per PM versus a generic-model baseline, so the moat is defensible even at one user, and surface NDR, retention, and autonomy on real accounts.

Dependencies: C1, E (so NDR/retention have paying accounts). Code: `src/lib/gauntlet.functions.ts`, `src/lib/gauntlet-metrics.ts`.

---

### Epic D · The dual-user MCP and public API

Make "agent-friendly" true: expose the typed handoff contract so external agents and the user's tools integrate.

**D1 · MCP server** · Priority P1 (M-D) · Status: **Missing**

> As an external agent (the agent-as-user persona), I want to query a team's decision and memory layer and hand work into their governed loop through MCP, so I can act on their product context without a human relaying it.

Acceptance criteria:

- An MCP server exposes read access to decisions and memory and a write path that hands a task into the governed loop, subject to the same approval modes as a human-initiated mission.
- The surface maps to the existing typed A2A `HandoffPayload`; it does not invent a second contract.

Dependencies: B0, B3 (governance applies to agent-initiated work too). Note: the canon recommends pulling this forward ahead of M-D as a fast-follower defense; treat the M-D label as the latest acceptable date, not the earliest.

**D2 · Documented public API** · Priority P1 (M-D) · Status: **Missing**

> As an integrator, I want a documented public API for signals in, decisions out, and mission status, so the user's other tools integrate without screen-scraping.

Acceptance criteria:

- A documented, authenticated API covers signal ingest, decision read, and mission status at minimum.
- Auth and rate limiting are enforced (closes the KI-10 class of risk for the public surface).

Dependencies: B4, D1. Defer build-your-own-agent marketplace; preserve the contract.

---

### Epic E · Pricing, entitlements, and the shareable-decision viral loop

Monetize on memory persistence and outcomes; grow through a public redacted decision card.

**E1 · Plan tiers and memory-expiry entitlement** · Priority P0 (M-C) · Status: **Missing**

> As an individual PM, I want a free tier that lets me try the loop and a Pro tier whose pull is that my decision memory never expires, so the value of paying is the moat I have been building.

Acceptance criteria:

- Free: one workspace, ritual capped, webhook ingest, memory expires (around 30 days).
- Pro (around $39/mo): unlimited ritual, persistent decision memory that never expires, Critic everywhere, shareable decision links.
- Team: value- or outcome-anchored, shared memory, per-role approval lanes; charged on memory persistence and decisions or outcomes, not per-seat or per-run. The >$150/mo bar is piloted as fixed-fee outcome contracts with design partners, asserted as a price only after churn under 5% per month across at least 10 teams.
- Entitlements are enforced at the chokepoint, including the memory-expiry job on Free.

Dependencies: C1 (memory must exist to expire or persist), margin controls (BYOK and small-model routing per the canon, since agentic cycles run 5 to 30 times token-intensive). Code: extends `src/lib/byokeys.functions.ts` and the runtime chokepoint.

**E2 · Shareable decision link (the viral loop)** · Priority P0 (M-C) · Status: **Built (entry surface) · Partial (funnel)**

> As a PM building in public, I want to share a public, redacted decision card so my network sees Cadence's reasoning and follows the link back.

Acceptance criteria (Built):

- A public decision page (`/d/$slug`) renders one decision marked public, server-side, with full OG tags (title, rationale, image); anonymous readers see only safe columns. This is the viral loop entry point and is live. The same anon-scoping hardening was applied to the prototype surface `/p/$slug` (KI-17, fix committed, awaiting sync).

Acceptance criteria (required for M-C):

- The signup funnel attributes inbound from a decision link, so we can prove a shared decision drives signups (the M-C exit criterion).

Dependencies: E1 (shareable links are a Pro entitlement). Code: `src/routes/d.$slug` (public, SSR), `src/routes/p.$slug`.

**E3 · PLG funnel and ritual continuity conversion** · Priority P1 (M-C) · Status: **Partial**

> As an individual PM, I want my daily ritual and persistent memory to be the reason I convert, not a paywall in my face.

Acceptance criteria:

- Conversion is driven by memory persistence and ritual continuity (the ritual session is already recorded for the retention metric).
- The funnel is instrumented end to end (decision-link inbound through activation through conversion).

Dependencies: E1, E2, B3. Code: `recordRitualSession` (Built, feeds Metric B), funnel instrumentation (Missing).

---

### Epic F · Onboarding to first value under 10 minutes on real data

The activation promise: a real new user signs up and the loop closes once on their own data, fast.

**F1 · Signup that completes** · Priority P0 (M-0) · Status: **Partial (fix committed, unapplied)**

> As a new user, I want signup to actually create my account.

Acceptance criteria:

- A real signup completes and seeds profile plus default workspace. The KI-13 fix wraps each seed step in its own subtransaction so a failed seed logs a warning and signup still completes (the app self-heals profile and workspace).
- Verified on a fresh signup after the migration sync.

Dependencies: M-0 migration sync. Status: fix landed in code (`20260614140000`), blocked on sync; until then live signup 500s and no account can be created.

**F2 · First-run onboarding to a closed loop** · Priority P0 (M-A) · Status: **Partial**

> As a new user, I want a first-run flow that gets me from signup to one closed loop on my own data in under 10 minutes.

Acceptance criteria (Built):

- A full-viewport onboarding flow exists, gated on `profiles.onboarded`, with no app shell.

Acceptance criteria (required for M-A exit):

- The flow connects at least one real ingest source (a working connector or the webhook) and walks the user to one closed loop (a signal sensed, a call decided, an outcome learned) on their data, measured under 10 minutes.

Dependencies: B0, B3, B4 or B5 (a real source), F1. Code: `OnboardingFlow`, `getColdStart`.

---

## 5. Success metrics

Launch is gated on the proof gauntlet, not a date. The three engine metrics already compute over real tables at `/govern?tab=gauntlet`; the business metrics are instrumented as paying accounts arrive.

| Metric                        | Definition                                                                                      | Target                                                           | Status                                                                                              | Source                                     |

Founder launch gate (locked 2026-06-14): at least 10 PMs paying around $150/mo, the loop closes once on a partner's real data, and the autonomy ratio ticks up on a real account.

## 6. Open questions

- **Critic: routable agent or inline call.** Today Critic is an inline LLM call surfaced as a badge. M-B promotes it to a DECIDE loop step. The open question is whether it also becomes a routable, seeded agent or stays a special inline step inside the orchestrated loop.
- **How far to ambient-default safely.** New users default to `observing`. M-A loosens this with a visible on-ramp, but the safe starting point for a brand-new account (how much reversible work to let the loop run before any track record exists) is unsettled.
- **The outcome-pricing unit.** Per decision-cycle or per shipped outcome. The Team tier charges on memory persistence and decisions or outcomes, but the exact billable unit is open (§14 of the canon).
- **The team-price number.** The >$150/mo bar is a 2.5 to 10 times premium over PM-tool willingness-to-pay. It is a hypothesis to validate through retention proof and fixed-fee outcome pilots, not a decided price.
- **Migration-sync ownership.** The recurring live-blocker pattern is migrations committed but unapplied (KI-09, KI-12, KI-13, KI-14, KI-17, the memory-scope fix). M-0 calls for an owned apply-and-verify step rather than a passive wait. The open question is who owns it and the manual-apply fallback if the sync lags more than a week.
- **The fast-follower window.** The canon flags that the 18 to 24 month whitespace may be 6 to 12 months if Atlassian or Productboard bundle the loop. This argues for pulling the MCP and API surface (Epic D) forward ahead of its M-D label. How far forward is a sequencing call against the M-0 to M-C work.
