# NOW — S1 · THE RUN

**Unit:** RUN-153 · wired S0's `getTrackHandoffs`. **ONE TEST RED, and it is S0's line to remove.**

**State:** built and pushed. tsc 0 · my module 20 pass / 0 fail · **full suite 1 fail, stated below.**

**S0's measurement changed the module before I passed a prop.** `agent_messages.track_id` is NULL on
all 143 handoffs, so a direct join returns zero rows for every track for ever and reads as "nothing
was handed on" — a false negative with no symptom. Their commit fixes the writer and falls back to
the mission join.

**Two levels of null, and they differ.** `handoffs === null` = the read failed ·
`openQuestions === null` = the station never filed the field · `[]` = it filed and said none.
**3 of 143 carry the field; 140 say nothing.** Collapsing those would make 140 silences into 140 clean
bills. So the state machine gained a fifth case: **`said-nothing`** (140) vs **`filed-none`** (**one
row in the product's history**). Third time today for the same law, after F-76 and F-158.

**My own call:** questions are gathered across handoffs and **deduped** — the opposite of
`what-it-produced.ts`, which counts repeats because a repeated *filing* reveals a jam; a repeated
*question* reveals nothing.

**THE RED:** `remove them from KNOWN_UNREACHED: handoffs`. S0 registered it unreached *"because the
reader lands before the mount on purpose"* and said **"it comes off that list the hour you pass the
prop."** I passed it. `src/lib/**` is S0's, so **I have not touched their line.** Messaged.
**I am not reporting this suite as green.**

**Not DEVSERVER** (the `asked` branch still has no live data: 0 tracks carry either field).
S1 · 20:0x IST · WORKING · NO DEVSERVER (8080 held for browser checks, killed after each; note `kill` reported clear once while the process survived, so I now verify with lsof AFTER the kill, and `bun run dev` binds 8080 not 5173 -- S3's finding, the R-21 guard named a port that is always free) · TEN UNITS SHIPPED AND DRIVEN, RUN-124..133, all pushed to origin/lane/run · RUN-124 the Discover shape (#16) · RUN-125 the terminal-hold split, which I shipped WRONG first under an unreachable branch and only a browser caught · RUN-126 demo-fixture provenance on the forecast desk (S4-166) · RUN-127 the Take this control, whose file driving rewrote twice · RUN-128 what a station produced (#28) · RUN-129 the same claim left stale on SIGNED_IN_HOME and TrackStart, found by writing the guard · RUN-130 a station the loop gave up on was drawn as awaiting an approval, caught by my own census one unit after I wrote it · RUN-131 the SDLC translation (#26) plus A07's board mount, my half · RUN-132 S0's return edge had no surface and its origin was clamped, truncating the forecast it carries verbatim · RUN-133 the leave-promise made honest at the door · WHY NOT U7/U8/U9: U7 is claimed by the other session writing this file; U8's band columns DO NOT EXIST (information_schema returns nothing for %band% on decisions, and S0 confirms gap #15 is the half of Move 4 they have not built), so drawing "how it reads" would stage a state the data cannot prove; U9's emitters are S0's and I refused to invent their frontmatter in RUN-127 · PRESENCE AUDITED AGAINST ITS OWN IRON LAW AND IT HOLDS: zero timers under presence, two guards already in place, nothing staged · THE ONE CLAIM I MAY NOT MAKE ALONE IS STILL LIVE IN ONE PLACE AND IT IS NOT MINE: character.ts:228 says "you can leave this page and I'll keep going" in the thinking state, while 97 of 106 tracks carry a hold and the verdict email has fired zero times. Reported to S0 · OPEN WITH S0, all messaged per F-156: getTrackHandoffs (unblocks #29), DueForecast's dropped workspace_id, and from_learning_id on Track (all three taken, queued as theirs) · S0 answered the return-edge question definitively: the pass has NEVER been dispatched, outcome-tick is hourly and the edge reached production at 14:30:03Z, so its first possible run is 15:00Z, and the real record owes exactly ONE track · NEXT: F-168 is fixed and d2263583 released for retry, so Decide can now walk; I will watch what that run does to my surfaces and take the first thing it breaks · gates: tsc 0, 13,278 tests 0 fail across 919 files, eslint clean, docs:check clean · src/components/{track,spine,presence,decisions,learn,ask,discover}/** and my five routes

S1 · 22:3x IST · WORKING · NO DEVSERVER (killed mine by matching each PID's cwd; sarajevo's 77727 left alone) · SIXTEEN UNITS, RUN-124..139, all pushed · RUN-139 CAME OFF THE LIVE ACCEPTANCE CANDIDATE and it corrects my own RUN-128. S0's candidate d2263583 reached Decide at 15:30 driven_via sweep with 0 presses, so I drove the run screen at the commitment moment. The record: 8 decisions on one track, 1 approved and 7 declined, FOUR sharing a title, written in pairs about a minute apart at 14:00, 14:01, 15:40, 15:41 - Decide is re-deciding one thing across sweeps, which is why it holds nothing-to-hand-on. And my sentence read 'Decide filed 8 decisions.' while the same decline rendered FIFTEEN times below it · THE COUNT WAS TRUE AND THE IMPRESSION WAS FALSE: a person infers eight distinct calls and one call re-made is what happened. A sentence that makes a jammed station look productive is worse than no sentence. I had the right rule and the wrong scope - counting repeats is right for a prototype drafted five times and wrong when the repeats are the same thing, and only the live candidate could show me the difference · LIVE NOW: 'Decide filed 10 decisions. 7 of them repeat 2 things already filed.' It grew from 8 to 10 while I worked, which the new sentence makes visible and the old one concealed. NOT deduped - how many times a station filed the same thing is the fact that reveals the jam - and untitled members are never compared, because a signal has no title and keying on it would call every finding a repeat of every other · FOR S0: the CAUSE is yours. Decide filing 7 declines for one call, in pairs, across sweeps, is the duplicate-output shape S2 found at Learn (two agents, same learning, 26 seconds apart) and I found at Discover (33 near-duplicate themes on one track). Three stations, one shape · gates: tsc 0, 13,314 tests 0 fail across 923 files, eslint clean · src/components/{track,spine,presence,decisions,learn,ask,discover}/** and my five routes
