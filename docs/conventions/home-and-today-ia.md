# Convention: home (Today) and surface-placement IA

> **STALE, 2026-08-22.** Written 2026-06-16, before the 2026-07 rebuild and before Meridian. Its "where does X go" answers predate the current rail (Today / Runs / Brain / Guardrails). The durable rules — Today is not a dashboard; every artifact has one home; relocate and curate rather than delete — still hold.

**Status: standing rule, founder ruling 2026-06-16. This evolves the early v5 "Today = tight ritual" idea (which was written before we had built and felt the product) into an enforceable IA. Where this and the old v5 canon disagree, this wins.**

## The rules

1. **Today is an ACTIONABLE command center, not a PASSIVE dashboard** (founder ruling 2026-06-16, second pass — this sharpens the earlier "Today is not a dashboard"). Today (`/`) answers one question the instant it opens: _what needs me, what should I push, and what changed while I was away?_ It carries: the calls that need a human now (primacy); a tight **pulse** of the few PM vitals a product manager actually acts on (the decisions-accepted and autonomy trust metrics, spend, the week's activity as a hand-sketched line); the **top priorities** to push (ICE, as a sketched bar chart); what is **stuck** (bottlenecks); **what changed** (the latest loop outcome); a light brief; and a dispatch affordance. The test is **act-on-ability in one to three clicks**, not "is it a number." What never lives on Today is the _passive dump_: deep analytics, full trend explorers, portfolios, raw activity logs, history, configuration, and any metric the PM only reads but never acts on. Those live on their stations (Govern / Knowledge), one click away. A curated vital that links to its deep view is welcome; the full analytics surface is not. The dashboard is _little, live, and interactive_ (pencil-sketch marks, subtle motion), never a wall of panels.

2. **Relocate and curate, never delete or textualize.** When content moves off a surface, it lands in its right home in its _best_ representation (the rich visual / chart / dashboard form, whichever delivers the most value there), exactly preserved or improved. The destination gains the good version. Rich visuals (for example the autonomy `observing -> proving -> trusted` stage strip, which lives on the Gauntlet) are never flattened into prose, and nothing is dropped just because a thinner copy exists elsewhere. Before removing a panel from a surface, open its destination and either preserve the visual into it, keep the destination's form because it is better, or improve the destination.

3. **Editorial hierarchy over card-stacks.** Hierarchy comes from type and whitespace; a surface earns at most a few containers. Identical card grids and the hero-metric template (big number, small label, supporting stats) are banned (they read as AI slop and break `docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md`'s no-filler law).

## The surface-placement rubric (the durable answer to "where does this go")

Before adding any panel, feature, or metric, apply this test so Today never re-clutters and we never re-do this cleanup:

- **Does the human ACT on it the moment they open the app** (a call / approval, a bottleneck, the top priority to push, what changed), **is it a curated PM vital they act on** (a trust metric / spend / activity, shown tight and linking to its deep home), **or is it the tight while-away summary?** If yes, it may sit on Today as a command-center element. Keep it tight: a vital is one figure with a trend mark or one sketched mark, not a panel.
- **Otherwise — passive reading, deep analysis, full trend explorers, history, config — it goes to its station by loop stage:** sense / decide -> **Product**; define -> **Product** (Specs); build -> **Missions** / **Build**; ship -> **Product** (Releases); learn + observe in depth (full metrics, trend explorers, the gauntlet, traces, drift, analytics) -> **Govern** or **Knowledge**. A curated count/vital on Today that _links_ to one of these is fine; the full surface is not.
- **Every artifact type has exactly one home.** If the same thing renders in two places, one is wrong (single-source it; a quick badge or count that links to the home is fine, a duplicate panel is not).

Worked example (the 2026-06-16 de-clutter): the autonomy stage visual -> Gauntlet; project progress ("Where the work stands") -> Product; agent activity + throughput -> Missions; spend + runs -> Govern/Analytics; meetings -> Knowledge/Calendar (a count on Today's lede); tasks stayed on Today (the `/tasks` redirect target).

Worked example (OPS-01 Flow mode, 2026-06-16): a global operating stance (calm focus: dim chrome + ambient sound + quiet notifications) is not an act-on-it call or a curated vital, so it goes to the **chrome, not Today** — the control sits in the `AppShell` sidebar footer beside the theme toggle, exactly like theme. Stances and session toggles live in the chrome; Today stays the command center.

Worked example (the 2026-06-16 command-center pass): after de-cluttering, the survivors were composed into a live little dashboard — a Pulse strip (decisions-accepted % and autonomy % with trend marks, spend, a hand-sketched activity sparkline) over an asymmetric action row (Top priorities as a sketched ICE bar chart, with Bottlenecks + What-changed stacked beside it). Each is a curated PM vital or action that links to its deep station (the gauntlet, Product, Govern, Knowledge); none is a full analytics surface. The pencil-sketch marks (`SketchLine` / `SketchBar`, per `docs/design/archive/ember-editorial-landing.md`) and the opt-in draw-in + press motion are how it reads as modern and live rather than an old-school panel — see [`design-context.md`](./design-context.md) "Motion is craft."

## Why

The home had drifted into ~15 stacked look-alike panels with no hierarchy: a dump, not a tool. A new user could not tell what needed them. This rubric makes the fix self-enforcing so the next build self-answers placement instead of piling onto Today.

## How to apply

On any new surface or panel: run the placement rubric first; if it is not "needs the human now" or the while-away summary, it does not go on Today. When removing content from a surface, relocate it (best representation, destination made good), never delete or textualize a rich visual.
