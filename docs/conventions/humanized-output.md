# Convention: humanized output, zero AI fingerprints

> _Created: 2026-06-14 · Last updated: 2026-08-03_

> ## ⛔ EXPLICIT FOUNDER COMMAND, 2026-08-03. Read this before cleaning a single dash.
>
> **Clean AI fingerprints only where a consumer can see them. Never in code a consumer cannot see.**
>
> **IN SCOPE, must be perfect:** consumer-facing screens (UI copy, labels, empty states, error messages, anything rendered) · outcomes the platform generates for a user (PRDs, drafts, chat, research, rationales) · public pages.
>
> **OUT OF SCOPE. Do not spend a token here:** backend and server source code · code comments, including comment tails on real code · `.md` docs · `.sql` migrations · tests.
>
> His words: *"only on the consumer exposed user facing screens and outcomes needs to be completely proof. But it's okay to have it at the source code back end, which is not consumer facing, because earlier you were fixing even the back end source code. That's a waste of time for us and token and energy."*
>
> This is not a relaxation of the standard, it is a redirection of where the standard is paid for. The runtime sanitizer at the AI chokepoint still protects every generated output unconditionally, so nothing a user reads loses coverage. `scripts/check-humanized.sh` is scoped to match by an allowlist (`src/components/`, `src/routes/`, the prompt and humanizer modules), and an allowlist can only narrow by accident, never widen.

> ## ⭐ THE POSITIVE BAR (founder command, 2026-08-03). Removing fingerprints is half the job.
>
> **Every message a user reads must feel written by a person who knew their situation.** Not merely free of AI tells: actually written. A heading, a dialog, an empty state, an error, a generated outcome, a prompt we display.
>
> His words: *"it needs to be absolutely customized and personalized like human... catering to the enterprise standards, what customers would love to see, and being empathetic as well, not just randomly showing. It needs to be contextual."*
>
> The four tests, all of which a string passes before it ships:
>
> 1. **Contextual, not generic.** It names *this* situation with *this* data. "Nothing here yet" is generic. "No signals since Tuesday, so Discover has nothing new to rank" is contextual. If the same sentence would fit on ten other screens, it is not finished.
> 2. **Empathetic where something went wrong, and only there.** A failure names what broke, what it cost the person, and what happens next. It never apologises decoratively and never performs concern. Warmth without information is worse than a blunt fact.
> 3. **Enterprise-credible.** It could appear in Stripe's or Linear's product without looking out of place. No exclamation marks, no cheerleading, no emoji in body copy, no hedging on a confirm.
> 4. **Written for one reader.** Second person, present tense, specific. "We were unable to process your request" is nobody talking to nobody. "That deploy is still running, so Ship is holding the gate" is someone telling you something.
>
> **A worked pair, because the rule is easy to nod at and hard to apply:**
>
> | Passes a fingerprint scan, still fails | Ships |
> | --- | --- |
> | "No items to display." | "No signals since Tuesday. Discover has nothing new to rank." |
> | "An error occurred. Please try again." | "The build stopped at the merge gate: 3 tests failed. Nothing was pushed." |
> | "Successfully created 1 opportunity!" | "Filed as a bet. Decide will rank it against the other four." |
> | "We understand this may be frustrating." | (delete it, and say what you are doing about it) |
>
> Both columns are free of em dashes and AI clichés. The left column is still machine output, which is why the checker cannot be the whole standard: **the fingerprint scan is automatable, this bar is not.** It is a judgment you apply while writing, and it is the difference between text that survives a scan and text a customer likes.
>
> Length budgets and the buzzword denylist are in [`ui-voice.md`](./ui-voice.md). This is the standard those budgets serve.

> **What this is.** The master rule that no text a **user** reads carries a machine fingerprint. Two levels:
>
> 1. **What we author for a user to see.** UI copy, labels, error text, marketing copy, seed data that surfaces. Applies to every co-development tool equally (Claude Code, Lovable, Gemini, Antigravity, and any future one).
> 2. **What the platform generates.** Every output the product produces for a user through an AI feature: PRDs, drafts, chat replies, research summaries, decision rationales. The end user's outcome must read as if a sharp human wrote it.
>
> Code comments, docs and migrations were in an earlier version of this list. They are not any more; see the command above.
>
> [`ui-voice.md`](./ui-voice.md) is the UI-string application of this rule (length budgets + the buzzword denylist). This file is the umbrella and adds the parts that rule does not cover: it extends scope to all authored text and to runtime-generated output, bans invisible characters, and specifies the runtime enforcement.

## Priority and scope (apply at authoring time, read this first)

Write clean from the first keystroke. This rule is an authoring habit invoked **before** you write, not a QA step after. Do not write text with fingerprints and then scan, correct, and rescan it: that four-step cycle wastes time and tokens. Know the banned set up front and just author without them.

Enforcement is tiered (founder ruling, 2026-06-16):

- **Tier 1, hard gate, non-negotiable: platform output and user-facing UI copy.** Anything the product generates or shows an end user (PRDs, chat replies, research summaries, decision rationales, drafts, and the in-app UI strings) is the verbatim that actually matters. The runtime sanitizer at the AI chokepoint (`humanizeText` in `runtime.server.ts`) is the real gate for generated text; UI copy is authored clean.
> ### ⭐ Tier 2 is now NOT SCANNED AT ALL (founder ruling 2026-08-03). Read this before "fixing" a dash.
>
> The earlier wording ("write clean by habit, no enforcement pass") was still being read by agents as
> a reason to go clean up backend source comments, and `scripts/check-humanized.sh` was still
> reporting them, so the cost kept getting paid anyway. The ruling closes that:
>
> **Look for AI fingerprints only where a user can see them. Everywhere else, leave them and move on.**
>
> - **Fix:** UI copy, error and empty-state text, prompt text, seed data, anything the platform
>   generates for a user, and any public-facing page.
> - **Do not fix, do not scan, do not spend a token on:** code comments (including a whole JSDoc
>   block), `.md` docs, `.sql` migration prose, commit messages, build logs. An em dash in an
>   engineer's explanation of why a function exists is not an AI fingerprint. It never reaches a user.
>
> The checker enforces exactly this rather than relying on anyone remembering it: it scans `.ts` and
> `.tsx` **code lines only**, skipping `//` lines, `*` JSDoc lines, `/* ... */` blocks and trailing
> comment tails, and it no longer looks at `.md` or `.sql` at all. Passing a path explicitly still
> scans that file whatever its extension, which is the deliberate opt-in for a public page authored
> as markdown. If you find yourself editing a comment purely to remove a dash, stop: that is the
> exact work this ruling deleted.

- **Tier 2, write clean by habit, no enforcement pass: internal docs, code comments, commit messages, build logs.** Write these clean because it is the house style, but they do **not** warrant a dedicated detect-fix-rescan pass or a token spend chasing a stray dash. A residual fingerprint in an internal doc is acceptable; there is no required scan loop and no separate doc-cleanup stage for Tier 2. **Reinforced by the velocity ruling (founder, 2026-06-19, [`../../AGENTS.md`](../archive/agent-operating-manual.md) §3):** do NOT run a per-cycle authored-content humanization scan; any whole-repo authored-text cleanup (HUMAN-SWEEP) is batched to the founder-prompted pre-launch stage. Tier 1 (the runtime sanitizer) stays the only live, non-deferred humanization gate.

## The rule

Ship text that reads human and reads like _this_ product. Two failure modes are banned: the **fingerprint** (mechanical tells that say "a model wrote this") and the **template** (generic phrasing that reads like one in a thousand AI apps). Remove the first. Beat the second with a point of view.

## Banned fingerprints (remove every one)

**Punctuation.**

- No em dash (`—`) or en dash (`–`) anywhere in shipped or generated text. Replace with a period, comma, colon, parentheses, or a line break. Plain hyphens stay only inside compound words (`role-based`, `auto-confirm`) and code.
- No "smart" dash sequences as separators. No trailing `!`. No `...` filler.

**Invisible and look-alike characters.** These are the silent giveaway. Strip them entirely:

- Zero-width: `U+200B` zero-width space, `U+200C` ZWNJ, `U+200D` ZWJ, `U+2060` word joiner, `U+FEFF` BOM / zero-width no-break.
- No-break and exotic spaces: `U+00A0` non-breaking space, `U+202F` narrow no-break, the range `U+2002` to `U+200A` (en, em, thin, hair spaces). Use a normal space.
- Soft hyphen `U+00AD`. Directional marks `U+200E` / `U+200F`. Replacement char `U+FFFD`.
- No trailing whitespace, no double spaces, no stray tabs in prose.

**Phrasing and structure (the template tells).**

- Buzzwords: the full denylist lives in [`ui-voice.md`](./ui-voice.md) (`seamless`, `leverage`, `empower`, `robust`, `unlock`, `delve`, `elevate`, `supercharge`, `cutting-edge`, and the rest). Do not duplicate it here. Honor it everywhere, not just in UI.
- Triple-pattern listicles ("faster, smarter, better"). Preamble ("In today's fast-paced world"). Hedging in confirms ("might", "could potentially"). Filler ("Let's dive in", "Feel free to", "It's worth noting that", "Certainly!"). Decorative emoji in body copy. Title Case Everywhere (use sentence case except product and page names).
- Over-uniform rhythm: every sentence the same length, every paragraph three sentences, every list exactly three items. Human writing varies.

## What "humanized and distinctive" means (do this)

- **Vary the rhythm.** Mix short and long sentences. Let a one-word line land.
- **Concrete over abstract.** Name the thing, the number, the effect. "This deletes 3 missions" beats "This action may affect your data."
- **Have a point of view.** The product has a voice (see `ui-voice.md`: clear, lightly playful in safe places, dry in governance and errors). Generic neutrality is the tell.
- **Product texture.** Use our nouns (calls queue, the loop, decision card, Chief of Staff), not stock SaaS nouns. The goal is that a screenshot reads as Supaprod and nothing else.

## The felt voice: generated output must hand the user value (standing precedent, founder 2026-06-22)

The bans above are the floor. Clearing them is necessary, not sufficient. Anything the product **generates** for a user (status updates, briefs, summaries, decision rationales, Critic verdicts, digests, nudges, drafts) must be **felt as valuable**: the user receives the thing they wanted, already put well, and gets it in one pass without effort. Five rules:

1. **Signal first.** Lead with the one thing that matters (the takeaway, the outcome, the call), then the supporting detail. The reader gets the point from the first line and reads on only if they want more.
2. **Short and precise.** Say exactly what it needs to say, then stop. Cut every word the user would skim. No preamble, no assistant framing ("Here's your update", "Hey", "Certainly"), no restating what the surface already shows.
3. **Context picks the voice.** Match the register to the content: a product-narrative line (what shipped, what is in flight) reads like a sharp colleague's note; a metric line is precise and interpreted, not a raw dump ("every reviewed bet held up", not "100.0% validated"); a governance or error line is dry and exact. One product, several registers, chosen by what is being said.
4. **Hand over meaning, not data.** If a surface only emits numbers and lists, it is not done. It must give the user the meaning they came for. A status update is a stakeholder note, not a table.
5. **Honest when sparse.** Say "a quiet week" rather than pad with zeros, and never invent a figure to look fuller. Honesty is part of the voice.

**The test (apply to every generated surface):** read the output cold. Did the user get exactly what they wanted, put well, in a single pass, feeling it was worth opening? If they have to work to extract the value, rewrite it.

**Scope and durability.** This is a PRECEDENT, not a one-surface note: it governs every surface we generate, going forward, the same way the fingerprint bans do. For LLM-generated output, encode it in that surface's prompt voice (`prompts.server.ts`); for deterministic/composed output, encode it in the composer. The runtime `humanizeText()` sanitizer enforces the fingerprint floor; this felt voice is the craft above it, an authoring responsibility on every surface that a sanitizer cannot add after the fact.

## Level 2: enforce it on runtime AI output (spec)

The platform's generated text must clear the same bar. Two layers, both required:

1. **Instruction layer.** The humanization directive ships inside the system prompt assembled in `src/lib/ai/prompts.server.ts`, so every model call (drafting, chat, research, reflection) is told to write human, avoid the banned fingerprints, and never emit dashes or invisible characters. Cheap, but not sufficient on its own (models drift).
2. **Sanitizer layer (the hard gate).** A pure `humanizeText()` pass runs on model output at the chokepoint (`src/lib/ai/runtime.server.ts`, both `callModel` and the streamed `callModelStream`) before the text reaches the user. It normalizes em/en dashes to honest punctuation, strips every invisible character above, collapses exotic spaces, and trims trailing whitespace. It must not touch fenced code blocks or inline code (a dash inside a code sample is legitimate). For streaming, sanitize on a buffered boundary so a multi-byte sequence is never split.

The sanitizer is the boundary; the prompt directive is convenience. Treat the sanitizer the way `runtime.server.ts` already treats guardrails and cost: a chokepoint everything passes through.

**Status (2026-06-14): wired.** The sanitizer lives in `src/lib/ai/humanize.ts` (pure `humanizeText` + `isFenceOpen`) and runs in `runtime.server.ts` on both `callModel` (output) and `callModelStream` (a line-buffered, fence-aware boundary) for prose responses. JSON responses (`responseFormat: 'json_object'`) are never sanitized, so structured output and the agent loop stay byte-exact. The soft directive is `HUMANIZE_DIRECTIVE` in `prompts.server.ts`. The build-time author-side guard now exists too: `scripts/check-humanized.sh` (warn-only, opt-in to strict) flags banned dashes and invisible characters in staged text additions. See "How to apply" below.

## How to apply (build time)

The runtime sanitizer (above) is the gate for Tier 1 generated output. The `rg` checks below are an **optional** spot-check for Tier 1 surfaces (UI copy, prompt templates) when you want to confirm by hand. They are not a required loop, and not for Tier 2 internal docs (see "Priority and scope"):

```bash
# 1. Dashes: must return 0 (outside code).
rg "—|–" <changed files>

# 2. Invisible characters: must return 0.
rg -nP "[\x{200B}\x{200C}\x{200D}\x{2060}\x{FEFF}\x{00A0}\x{202F}\x{00AD}\x{200E}\x{200F}\x{FFFD}]" <changed files>

# 3. Buzzwords (see ui-voice.md for the full list).
rg -i "seamless|leverage|empower|unlock|delve|elevate|supercharge|cutting-edge|at the intersection" <changed files>
```

A pre-commit / hook check enforcing 1 and 2 on staged text files is the durable backstop. It now exists at `scripts/check-humanized.sh`: it scans the staged diff for the banned dashes and the invisible-character set, skips fenced and inline code, and prints each hit as `file:line`. It is warn-only by default (always exits 0, never blocks a commit) and opt-in to strict with `STRICT=1` (exit non-zero on any hit). Run `scripts/check-humanized.sh` on the staged diff, or pass file paths to scan specific files whole. The ready-to-enable hook config and a plain git pre-commit snippet live in [`../operations/hooks.md`](../operations/hooks.md) (the "Humanized-output guard" section). It is not registered as a live blocking hook yet, in line with the deferred-sweep ruling below.

**The retroactive full-product sweep is deferred to a pre-launch gate (founder ruling 2026-06-14).** The docs were swept 2026-06-14 (README, strategy, feature docs), but existing static product text (UI strings, seed data, components, code-level user-facing copy) is swept once only, when the product is near-final, so churn in screens and features does not force a re-sweep. This is NOT a relaxation of the rule: all new authored text is built clean now, and generated output is already sanitized at runtime by `humanizeText()`. **Cutoff date: 2026-06-14.** The sweep covers only work authored before 2026-06-14 (the date this rule and the `humanizeText()` sanitizer landed); anything built on or after 2026-06-14 is authored under the rule and passes through the runtime sanitizer, so it is treated as already clean and is not re-scanned or re-fixed, to save time and tokens. Claude prompts the founder to run the full scan at that gate. Tracked in [`../planning/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md`](../planning/SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md) (founder pickup list, the pre-launch humanization sweep, section 4).

## Why

Two reasons, both load-bearing. First, trust: AI fingerprints make a product read as low-effort and machine-made, which is the opposite of the craft a PM pays for. Second, the platform's promise is that its _generated_ output is good enough to use as-is. A PRD with em dashes and zero-width spaces betrays the machine and breaks that promise.
