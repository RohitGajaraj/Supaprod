# Convention: UI voice & language

> _Created: 2026-06-06 · Last updated: 2026-06-22_

**Voice anchor.** Human, clear, lightly playful in safe places (empty states, success toasts). Dry in governance, errors, and destructive flows. Contractions on. Active voice. One idea per sentence. Linear-leaning, warmer in empty states.

> **Generated output carries this voice too, and must be felt as valuable.** For anything the product GENERATES for a user (status updates, briefs, summaries, verdicts, digests), clearing the bans below is the floor, not the job. Signal first, short and precise, context picks the register, hand over meaning not data, honest when sparse. The standing precedent + the cold-read test: [`humanized-output.md`](./humanized-output.md) "The felt voice" (founder, 2026-06-22).

**Length budgets.**

| Surface          | Budget        |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| H1               | ≤ 6 words     |
| Subhead          | ≤ 14 words    |
| Button label     | ≤ 3 words     |
| Tooltip          | ≤ 10 words    |
| Toast            | ≤ 12 words    |
| Empty-state copy | ≤ 2 sentences |

**Banned (AI tells).**

- **Dashes.** No em (`—`) or en (`–`) dashes in any user-facing string. Replace with period, comma, parentheses, colon, or line break. Hyphens stay only inside compound words (`role-based`, `auto-confirm`).
- **Invisible characters.** No zero-width or exotic-space Unicode (`U+200B`, `U+200C`, `U+200D`, `U+2060`, `U+FEFF`, `U+00A0`, `U+202F`, `U+00AD`, directional marks). They are a silent machine fingerprint. See the umbrella rule [`humanized-output.md`](./humanized-output.md), which also covers generated (AI-output) text and the runtime sanitizer.
- **Buzzwords.** `seamlessly`, `leverage`, `empower`, `robust`, `powerful`, `next-gen`, `AI-native`, `revolutionary`, `unlock`, `unleash`, `delve`, `navigate the landscape of`, `at the intersection of`, `elevate`, `supercharge`, `game-changing`, `cutting-edge`.
- **Patterns.** Triple-pattern listicles (_"faster, smarter, better"_). Preamble (_"In today's…"_). Hedging in confirms (_"might"_, _"could potentially"_). Filler (_"Let's dive in"_, _"Feel free to…"_). Decorative emoji (🚀 ✨ 🎉) in body copy. Title Case Everywhere (sentence case except product/page names). Trailing `!`.

**Confirm copy pattern.** Direct, name the effect: _"This deletes 3 missions. Continue?"_ — not _"Are you sure you want to proceed?"_. For reversible actions, prefer an Undo toast over a confirm.

**How to apply.** Before shipping any copy change:

```bash
rg "—|–" <changed files>     # must return 0
rg -i "seamless|leverage|empower|unlock|delve|at the intersection" <changed files>
```

**Why.** "Remove em dashes" was treated as the whole task; the buzzword list is what actually moves the brand needle. Operator-flagged on 2026-06-06.
