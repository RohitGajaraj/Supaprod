# v3 Audit: Language, Voice, Popups & Inline Workspace Management

> _Created: 2026-06-06 · Last updated: 2026-06-19_

Date: 2026-06-06 · Companion to `v3-audit.md` and `v3-audit-language.md`.
Status: P0 execution landed. P1 sweep open.

## 1. Mandate

Three coordinated course-corrections, in one pass:

1. Strip every AI-tell from user-facing copy (em dashes are one symptom, not the whole list).
2. Kill every browser-native popup (`alert`, `confirm`, `prompt`, unload blockers). Everything happens in-app.
3. Make workspace and product management inline. Operators should never leave the surface they're on to rename, switch, or remove something.

## 2. Voice

Human, clear, lightly playful where it's safe (empty states, confirmations). Dry in governance, errors, and destructive flows. Contractions on. Active voice. One idea per sentence.

Length budgets:

- H1 ≤ 6 words. Subhead ≤ 14. Button ≤ 3. Tooltip ≤ 10. Toast ≤ 12.

## 3. The full AI-tell list (banned)

Em dashes (`—`) and en dashes (`–`) are the most visible tell, but these patterns leak the same machine flavor and all go:

| Tell                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Replace with                                       |

Lint guardrail: planned regex sweep in CI as P1. For now, code review enforces.

## 4. Popup sweep (P0: landed)

Every `window.alert`, `window.confirm`, `window.prompt`, and bare `confirm(...)/prompt(...)` call has been replaced. Future ones are blocked at lint time.

### Primitives added

- `src/hooks/use-confirm.tsx`: exports `ConfirmProvider`, `useConfirm()`, `usePrompt()`. Promise-based, themed via shadcn `AlertDialog` and `Dialog`, keyboard-friendly, focus-trapped. Supports `destructive` styling and `typedConfirm` (type the name to enable the button).
- Provider mounted once in `src/routes/__root.tsx` inside `ThemeProvider`.

### ESLint guardrail (added)

`eslint.config.js` now bans the four globals (`alert`, `confirm`, `prompt`, `window.onbeforeunload`) with a clear error message pointing to `useConfirm` / `usePrompt` / `toast`. New popup calls fail lint.

### Call sites replaced

| File                                       | Before                                                 | After                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `src/components/cadence/AppShell.tsx`      | `window.prompt` (new workspace)                        | `usePrompt` dialog                 |
| `src/components/cadence/AppShell.tsx`      | `window.prompt` (new product)                          | `usePrompt` dialog                 |
| `src/components/cadence/AppShell.tsx`      | `window.confirm` (delete product)                      | `useConfirm` with typed-name guard |
| `src/routes/_authenticated.evals.tsx`      | `confirm()` × 2 (delete suite, delete case)            | `useConfirm`                       |
| `src/routes/_authenticated.guardrails.tsx` | `confirm()` (delete rule)                              | `useConfirm`                       |
| `src/routes/_authenticated.docs.tsx`       | `window.prompt` (Google Docs import)                   | `usePrompt`                        |
| `src/routes/_authenticated.docs.tsx`       | `window.prompt` (icon picker)                          | `usePrompt`                        |
| `src/routes/_authenticated.docs.tsx`       | `window.confirm` (delete doc)                          | `useConfirm`                       |
| `src/components/cadence/DocEditor.tsx`     | `window.prompt` × 3 (link, figma toolbar, figma slash) | `usePrompt`                        |

### Rules going forward

- Destructive flows: `useConfirm({ destructive: true })`. For workspace/product delete, also pass `typedConfirm: name`.
- Non-blocking feedback: `toast.success / toast.error` from sonner.
- Inputs: `usePrompt({ title, label, placeholder })`. For richer forms, build a proper `Dialog`. `usePrompt` is for one-field cases.
- Unsaved-changes guards: TanStack Router `useBlocker` wired to `useConfirm`. (Not yet needed; will land when the first form needs it.)

## 5. Inline workspace & product management (P0: landed)

### Server functions added

- `src/lib/workspaces.functions.ts`: `renameWorkspace`, `deleteWorkspace`, `leaveWorkspace`, `listWorkspaceMembers`, `removeWorkspaceMember`. All RLS-scoped (owner-only manage, member-only read).
- `src/lib/projects.functions.ts`: added `updateProject` (name, north_star, target_date, status).

### UI changes in `AppShell`

- Workspace switcher (top-left popover) now has a Manage section: Rename, Workspace settings, Leave, Delete. All inline.
- Each product row in the sidebar gets a `MoreHorizontal` dropdown: Set active, Rename, Delete. The bare trash icon is gone.
- Destructive workspace and product deletes require typed-name confirmation.
- All flows produce sonner toasts, never browser popups.

### Rules going forward

- Any "manage X" affordance lives in a dropdown next to the item, or a sheet that opens over the current page. Never a separate route just to delete or rename.
- Owners can't leave their own workspace. The server rejects it with a clear message; the UI surfaces it as a toast.

## 6. Em-dash sweep (P1: open)

Em dashes are still present in many UI strings (login subhead, Today brief empty state, AppShell comments, agent roster blurbs). P1 batch will sweep these route-by-route:

- `/login`, `/signup`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`
- `/` (Today): empty states, brief copy, agent rail
- `/agents`, `/missions`, `/swarm`, `/approvals`
- `/traces`, `/evals`, `/governance`, `/guardrails`, `/budgets`, `/drift`
- Public `/p/*` pages

Each sweep records before/after in this doc.

## 7. Out of scope (still)

- Product rename ("Cadence"), flagged in main v3 audit.
- IA restructure from 31 → 12 routes. Main v3 audit, separate decision.
- Invite-by-email: needs a server function with admin lookup of `auth.users` by email; deferred to P2 with workspace settings sheet.
- Billing surfaces.
- Localisation.

## 8. Verification

- `rg "window\.(alert|confirm|prompt)|^\s*(alert|confirm|prompt)\("` across `src/` returns zero hits (only a comment in `use-confirm.tsx`).
- ESLint config blocks future regressions.
- Workspace switcher and product dropdowns render in preview; every action confirms via in-app dialog or toast.

## 9. How to use / verify (per Core rule)

Operator-facing surfaces shipped in this pass and how to verify each:

| Surface                        | Where to find                                           | What it does                                                                                 | Server enforcement                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Verify                                                                                                                                                         |

## 10. Phased rollout

- **P0, shipped.** Primitives (`useConfirm`, `usePrompt`, `ConfirmProvider`), ESLint guardrail, popup sweep across 10 highest-traffic files, inline workspace + product management, voice rules + AI-tell list documented.
- **P1, open.** Em-dash + AI-tell sweep across the remaining 21 authenticated routes, public `/p/*`, and auth screens. Each route records before/after in §6.
- **P2, open.** Tooltip discipline pass (every tooltip ≤ 10 words, no tooltip that exists to define its own label) and microcopy patterns (empty states, error states, confirm prompts) per the voice anchor.

## 11. Learnings (so we don't repeat)

- **Em dashes were a symptom; AI-tells are the disease.** "Remove `—`" got picked up; the buzzword list (_seamlessly_, _leverage_, _empower_, _robust_, _unlock_, _delve_, _at the intersection of_) is what actually moves the brand needle. Always sweep both.
- **Native browser chrome is never the right answer.** `window.alert/confirm/prompt/open/onbeforeunload` break the theme, break keyboard nav, and read as "the team didn't finish this." One reusable `useConfirm()` is cheaper than the next discussion.
- **Doc the surface as you ship it.** The first version of this audit shipped without a "How to use / verify" block; the operator had to ask where the new switcher lived. The Core rule exists for a reason. Every user-facing surface lands with the block in the same turn.
- **Inline management beats a settings route.** Operators ranked "rename inline" above three other asks the same session. Manage-where-the-thing-lives is the default; a dedicated route is the exception.
- **Typed-name-match is cheap insurance.** One operator-typed string is the difference between "I deleted the wrong workspace" and "I won't make that ticket again."
- **Voice rules belong in `DESIGN.md`, not the audit only.** The audit is the _case_; `DESIGN.md` is the _contract_. Without the contract entry the next person ships an exclamation-point H1 and a triple-pattern subhead.
