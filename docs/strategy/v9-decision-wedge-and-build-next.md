# v9 - The Decision Wedge and the Build-Next Plan (decision lens + sharpened wedge + audit + what to build next)

> _Created: 2026-06-17 · Last updated: 2026-06-19_

**Date: 2026-06-17 (revised 2026-06-17 post-founder feedback). Status: CURRENT decision-lens + build-next canon.** This doc sits on top of v7 (positioning + market) and v8 (structure + build-order). It does not replace them. It adds four things they do not yet state plainly: (1) the first-principles reason the "Cursor for PM" category is real but the obvious product is a trap, (2) a sharper single launch wedge, (3) a clean competitor posture map (integrate / absorb / race / ignore), and (4) an honest audit of the current build with a concrete "what I would build next" plan grounded in the live feature dashboard. **Section 4 reconciles v8 Fork 1 (hybrid Build) with founder feedback: the model is tiered ownership (own 100% common path by default, delegation as escape-hatch fallback), not a 50-50 rent-vs-own split.**

> Born from a founder brainstorm (2026-06-16/17): a holistic read of Andrew Miklas's "Cursor for Product Managers" essay, played through the lenses of operator, PM-customer, investor, and marketer, then reconciled against what Supaprod has actually shipped. Where positioning and v9 disagree, v7 wins. Where structure / surface / build-order and v9 disagree, v8 wins. v9 governs the launch wedge, the competitor posture, and the build-next priority call.

**v9 is additive. It is the conceptual foundation + the launch wedge + the competitor posture + the build-next call.** Nothing here contradicts v7 or v8; where it sharpens them, it says so.

## 1. The conceptual foundation: why "Cursor for PM" is the right category and the wrong product

The Miklas essay is a good category-naming essay and a naive product essay. It is directionally right: once "how to build" is cheap, "what to build" becomes the bottleneck. That is just conservation of bottleneck. But it describes the product as a **synthesis pipeline** (upload interviews and usage data, get a feature outline plus UI / data-model / workflow changes plus tasks for a coding agent). That is the seductive demo. It is not the business. The gap between the two is where most entrants will die, and the reason is one structural asymmetry:

> **Code has a fast oracle. "What to build" does not.**

Cursor works because code is verifiable in seconds: it compiles or it does not, tests pass or they do not, you read the diff and reject it in two clicks, and a wrong edit costs nothing. That tight, cheap, ground-truth loop is _why_ AI coding exploded. "What to build" has no such oracle. Feedback on a product decision arrives in weeks to quarters, it is confounded by ten other variables, and a wrong call costs a team a quarter and a PM their credibility.

Everything strategic follows from that one fact:

1. **The correct autonomy model: reversible vs. irreversible gates.** "Fully autonomous/agentic" means no human gates on _reversible_ work — diff staging, self-correction after CI fail, branch rebase, re-planning. HITL (human-in-the-loop) gates only at _irreversible_ boundaries: merge to main, prod deploy, spend ceiling, destructive data ops. This is not the essay's "autopilot framing" (which v7 rightly rejected); it is the governed model already encoded in Supaprod's architecture. The moat lives in memory, not in avoiding human judgment.
2. **The only way to manufacture a feedback signal is to close the loop and remember the outcome:** decision, then what shipped, then what happened, then was the reasoning right. This is not a feature. It is the whole defensibility. So "memory is the moat" is not a positioning preference; it is the _only_ thing that turns this category into a business instead of a wrapper. v9 grounds v7 correction #2 in this first principle.
3. **The product is a judgment amplifier with an audit trail, not a "Cursor for PM."** The PM's grunt work (triage, synthesis, drafting, status, task graphs) gets removed; the PM's judgment gets made faster and defensible. Sell the second thing. The first is only the on-ramp.

**What the essay under-weights, and Supaprod must not:** ingestion is 80% of the unglamorous work ("upload your data" hides that real signal is sparse, scattered across 15 tools, and biased to loud customers), and accountability is the adoption gate (a wrong PR is auto-caught; a wrong roadmap bet is a career event, so the human must stay accountable, which is precisely the governed model). Both validate Supaprod's existing emphasis and flag SENSE plus LEARN as the un-commoditizable ends of the loop.

**The product is the autonomous loop, and that is the part to say out loud (founder steer, 2026-06-17).** The felt entry is a single moment (the §2 wedge), but the _product_ is the agent loop running intent to outcome: sense, decide, define, build, ship, learn, with agents executing and the human governing only at the gates that need judgment. The autonomy dial (observing, proving, trusted, ambient) is the mechanism that lets it feel progressively hands-off as trust is earned. The deepest design rule falls straight out of the oracle asymmetry above: **push autonomy hardest exactly where there is an oracle, and keep it governed exactly where there is not.** Code has an oracle (tests, CI, the build), so BUILD to QA to SHIP is the one place full autonomy is _safe_: the agent self-corrects against ground truth with no human in the inner loop. Product judgment has no oracle, so DECIDE stays human-governed at the gate. This is the precise, defensible version of "agents execute, humans govern": autonomy where truth is checkable, governance where it is not. It is also why owning the build engine and pushing it to full autonomy is _not_ in tension with ambient-plus-governed; it is the same principle applied where it is safe.

## 2. The sharpened launch wedge: the Critic teardown

The most dangerous thing in the current plan is the tension between the README's maximalist vision ("your product org, running itself," six stations, 19-agent mesh) and v7's honest "70% of a v1, last mile unfinished." A horizontal everything-platform with no addictive single loop is the most common way ambitious agentic products die in this market. Cursor did not launch as "the IDE that runs your eng org." It launched as autocomplete that was just better: one tight loop a developer felt in 60 seconds.

So the only question that matters for launch: **what does a PM feel in the first 10 minutes that makes them never go back?**

**The answer v9 commits to: the Critic teardown.**

> **"Supaprod will tell you why your pet feature is wrong, with receipts."** Point it at a feature you are already attached to. Watch it red-team your reasoning using evidence pulled from your own signals.

Why this wins as the wedge:

- It leads with **judgment**, not paperwork. Everyone else leads with PRD generation because paperwork demos well and judgment is hard. Paperwork is not differentiated and not shareable.
- It is **emotionally sticky and a little scary** (ego-death with evidence), which is exactly what makes it shareable. The shareable artifact for the viral loop (v7 §10, F-SHARE) should be the _Critic teardown_, not the PRD. "Watch an AI demolish my pet feature, then admit it was right" is a build-in-public post people actually share.
- It **does not require the full loop to work.** It needs signals in plus the Critic, both of which exist (DEC-02, F-DEC-CARD, runCritic). The rest of the loop is the expansion you grow into, not the thing a new user meets.

This refines v5 ("evidence-to-decision ritual") and v7 (general decide-ritual) to a single, demoable, first-run moment. It also sits cleanly under v8's two-heroes model: Today is where the Critic teardown lands ("your calls today"), Build is the ship-hero you grow into.

**Marketing implication:** do not try to create a category. "Agentic Product OS" is a strong internal north star and a terrible tagline (nobody searches for it). Enter an existing emotional category: _the AI that red-teams your roadmap_. Category creation is a tax a pre-PMF company cannot afford.

**Persona implication (sharpening v7 §5):** keep the dual-persona _destination_ and the serial-with-overlap _motion_, but collapse the _narrative_ to the individual PM (P2) until the single-player loop is addictive. "We are for everyone" is what pre-PMF companies say. The team tier is expansion, not a co-equal launch story.

**Operating-model frame (added 2026-06-17, "the year of the agent manager"):** layer the 2026 agent-manager shift _underneath_ the wedge, never as the headline. The role Supaprod gives the PM (decide what is worth building, direct the agent fleet, review what shipped) is exactly the emerging "agent manager" job, so it is a free narrative amplifier on the landing page: lead with "the AI that red-teams your roadmap," then "the operating model is shifting from doing the work to directing agents, and Supaprod is where a PM does that for product." Do **not** make it the category ("agent manager / agent ops" commoditizes into infrastructure and shifts the ICP to platform / eng buyers), and do **not** build an in-app surface named "Agent Manager" (the Engine-Room Doctrine's "control-room creep"; the capability already exists, outcome-named, in the Engine Room). The end-user value of "how much are the agents consuming" is reframed as **cost-per-outcome** (what you got for what you spent), kept light on the calm front, with full per-agent telemetry behind the Engine Room door.

## 3. The competitor posture map: integrate / absorb / race / ignore

In an agentic world where orchestration is commoditizing (MCP at ~97M installs, A2A, Agent Skills, MS Agent Framework), the buy / partner / build / ignore map _is_ the strategy. The rule: **own the ends of the loop (SENSE, LEARN/memory), integrate the middle, absorb the thin wrappers, and only race the players chasing the same closed loop.**

| Posture                                                            | Players                                                                      | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Integrate and orchestrate** (be Switzerland on top of them)      | Linear, Jira, GitHub, Cursor / Devin / Factory, Figma, Notion docs           | They own a workspace or an execution surface you cannot dislodge. Speak MCP / A2A both ways; let Supaprod be the decision-and-memory brain that drives them. Fighting them for the surface is suicide; sitting above them is leverage.    |
| **Absorb as a feature** (their whole product is one of your steps) | ChatPRD, generic AI-PRD tools, prompt-library PM GPTs                        | A PRD generator is one step in DEFINE. Their defensibility is distribution, not the artifact. You out-feature them by connecting the PRD to the signal that justified it and the outcome that judged it, which they structurally cannot. |
| **Race on the moat** (same ambition; you must out-data them)       | Productboard (Spark), Atlassian Rovo, Dovetail / Enterpret, Notion AI agents | The real fight. They have the data and distribution you lack. Your only durable edge is the outcome-memory flywheel and being cross-tool-neutral.                                                                                        |
| **Ignore / let plug in**                                           | Foundation labs shipping a horizontal "PM agent"                             | A lab's PM agent is a model you route to, not a competitor, _iff_ your value lives in proprietary outcome data plus governance plus PM-domain depth. The model-agnostic chokepoint already encodes this.                                 |

**The strategic punchline (sharpening v7 §14):** the existential threat is not the labs. It is that **Linear / Notion / Productboard / Atlassian already own the workspace, the data, and the distribution, and "discovery to spec to tickets" is a natural feature extension for all of them.** Productboard Spark and Linear-for-Agents are the canary. Plan for the short end of v7's 6-to-18-month window. The only two defenses that survive a bundled-feature attack are (a) the outcome-memory data they cannot backfill, and (b) being the neutral brain across tools so you are more valuable than any one of them locked-in.

**The implication that changes sequencing:** the MCP server plus public API (Q1 / F-MCP-V1) is currently filed under M-D / "later." Being the neutral brain across tools is a _moat_, not a late feature. Pull a thin read-only MCP surface forward (see §6). This is the single biggest sequencing change v9 argues for.

## 4. The Build engine, reconciled: tiered ownership and the end-to-end workflow

v8 Fork 1 settled the Build question as a **hybrid spine**, and v9 refines it: the right model is **tiered ownership**, not a 50-50 rent-vs-own split.

**On "why not build the whole Cursor-equivalent ourselves and keep all the revenue" (founder, 2026-06-17): mostly yes, with one precision.** First, the clarification that reframes everything: the 80/20 that matters is _agent-vs-human_ (how much the agent does autonomously), not easy-task-vs-hard-task. For the work a PM actually dispatches (a new field, a screen, a workflow, a CRUD feature, copy, an integration), autonomous coding is viable _today_ and the engine is already built. Three independent market facts back owning it rather than bolting on:

- **Switching is not the barrier for this buyer.** Developers run multiple coding tools side by side (Cursor for daily editing, Claude Code for hard tasks) and re-evaluate every 2 to 4 months; the stickiness is to the _engineer's IDE_, not the PM's surface. The PM buyer is not emotionally locked to Cursor; the founder's read is correct, value wins.
- **Consolidation is a 2026 tailwind.** ~93 apps per company, a McKinsey "consolidation wave" cutting SaaS 20 to 35% by 2027, ~70% of firms actively consolidating, CFOs demanding ROI on every renewal. "Do the whole lifecycle in one platform" is with the market, not against it.
- **The integrated spec is the accuracy multiplier, and it is the moat a bolt-on can never have.** The single biggest determinant of autonomous-coding success is task-description quality (Devin: ~67% PR-merge on well-scoped work, ~15-30% on vague or evolving work). A standalone Cursor/Devin gets a thin ticket. Supaprod feeds _its own_ engine a signal-grounded, Critic-hardened, cited PRD. Owning both ends means the build engine runs on better input than anyone else's can. This is the strongest argument for owning the engine, and it exists _only_ because Supaprod owns the upstream.

**The one precision (the trap to avoid):** do not aspire to be "Cursor." Cursor/Devin pour hundreds of millions into the _hardest 20%_ (deep refactors, ambiguous evolving work, IDE-grade ergonomics for senior engineers), exactly where even Devin still fails most and where a PM hands off to an eng team anyway. Owning _that_ frontier is the misallocation, and it is what turns a believable "2-week" build into a 12-month one. So: own the autonomous _delivery_ engine for PM-shaped work (already built; push it to full autonomy), and make delegate-out a **BYO-key escape hatch** for the rare heavy-eng task (the customer brings their own Cursor/Devin/Claude key through the model-agnostic chokepoint, so there is no revenue split and no margin leak; the default path stays 100% in-platform and 100% yours). This is how "everything stays inside my platform" and "keep all the revenue" both stay true without chasing a frontier you should not own.

- **Supaprod owns the common-path engine fully (default):** plan, file tree plus read plus search, multi-file diff review, per-hunk accept/reject, mid-run steering, CI read plus self-correct, review-gated in-platform merge, cost/model panel. This is built and Cursor-grade today (F-STUDIO, I1, I2, I3, J1, J2, K1 all done per the dashboard). This is the primary path; no timeboxing or deprecation.
- **Supaprod adds the justified 2-week investment (sandbox + live preview):** the one genuine new build is the sandboxed test execution plus live preview environment (v8 Phase 3). Cloudflare Workers cannot host on-disk worktrees or run tests locally, so integrating a sandbox service (Cloudflare Sandbox SDK, E2B, or Vercel Sandbox) closes the autonomy gap — tests run for real, preview renders for real, and self-correction after CI fail becomes a loop-driven action, not a polling wait. This is not competing with Devin; it is closing the platform's own loop.
- **Delegation as escape-hatch fallback (not default):** only when a mission classifier flags "heavy 20%" (large diff radius, cross-service, perf-critical refactors) does Supaprod delegate to external coding agents (Claude Code / Cursor / Devin) under the same governance and handoff contract (BLD-04, not yet built). Treat it as graceful degradation, not a primary path. This keeps revenue and margin predictability (no per-mission cost variance outside your control) while still handling the rare heavy case.
- **Why tiered, not 50-50 split?** A binary "own 80%, rent 20%" creates two problems: (1) customers feel the seam (handoff failures, credential confusion, feature inconsistency), and (2) you carry the cognitive burden of two engines, even if the 20% sees low traffic. Tiered ownership means the default is seamless (100% inside), the escape hatch is explicit (only when needed, and the user knows why), and you do not carry two architectures in your head. This is what "everything stays inside the platform" means operationally.

### The end-to-end workflow (founder's question: signal to code to ship, seamless, zero-friction?)

Honest answer: **the spine from signal to shipped PR is largely built and seamless; the two gaps are capability gaps (delegate-out and outcome learning), not friction gaps.** The user touches the loop at exactly two governance gates, not a dozen juggling points.

                                         (only if mission classifier flags it; graceful degradation)
```

- **The seam from PRD to coding mission is already one approval** (`dispatchStudioSession`, with a `prd -> mission` lineage edge). That is the zero-friction handoff the founder asked about, and it exists.
- **Gap A (justified work):** sandbox + live preview (v8 Phase 3, 2-week investment). Until built, tests run via CI polling. Once built, self-correction becomes a real loop action (tests fail, agent re-plans, re-diffs, re-submits, all in-platform). This is the work that closes the autonomy loop.
- **Gap B (capability, and this is the moat):** the merged outcome rescoring memory is wired (W1), but real predicted-vs-actual outcome reviews (LRN-02) and cohort analytics (F-ANALYTICS) are not built. This is what actually _closes_ the loop and makes memory compound. It is v8 Phase 4 and it is the highest-leverage unbuilt work.

So: zero-friction at the seams that exist; the work left is adding the two capabilities (sandbox, outcome learning), not removing juggling.

## 5. The honest audit: what is good, what is not

Build-state sourced from the reconciled [feature dashboard](../planning/feature-dashboard.md) (file-evidence reconciled 2026-06-16). The strategic read is v9's.

**What is genuinely good (protect and lean on these):**

- **The autonomous engine is real and verified** (G0: 11/11 done). The loop advances unattended, memory threads and compounds (W1), governance is honest (executed-unattended audit, kill-switch, spend caps). This is better than most "agentic" vendors ship, and it is the substrate the moat needs.
- **The Build spine is Cursor-grade and complete** (G3: 8 done). Branch isolation, per-hunk curation, live cockpit, CI gate, release notes. This is the loop-closing demo and, pushed to full autonomy, the USP (§4). Protect and deepen it for PM-shaped work; the only thing to _not_ chase is the senior-eng IDE frontier.
- **The decide-ritual exists** (Critic on opportunities DEC-02, decision card F-DEC-CARD, shareable link F-SHARE). The launch wedge (§2) is buildable from parts that already exist.
- **The structure doctrine is sound** (v8 calm-front, Engine Room door). The product was drifting into a control room; v8 corrects it.

**What is not good yet (the honest gaps, in priority order):**

1. **The loop does not yet close on real data.** SENSE is webhook-only in practice (F-CONN parked pending OAuth registration; only 1 live ingest path). LEARN's outcome reviews (LRN-02) and analytics (F-ANALYTICS) are unbuilt. The moat cannot compound until both ends are fed. **This is the single most important gap.**
2. **The wedge is not yet packaged.** The Critic teardown exists as parts, not as a first-run, 10-minute, shareable moment. No persona onboarding (W6), no PLG funnel (PLG).
3. **Interop is mis-sequenced.** MCP/API (Q1) is "later," but §3 argues it is a moat against the workspace incumbents and should be pulled forward.
4. **Monetization rails are built but dark** (M-C-PRICE needs Stripe secrets; M-C-EXPIRY dormant). Real, but not switched on.
5. **Autonomy not yet fully closed in Build.** The engine is built, but _full_ autonomy still needs the sandbox/preview (so self-correction is a real loop action, not CI polling) plus the BYO-key escape hatch for the heavy 20%. The misallocation to avoid is chasing the senior-eng IDE frontier; the work to do is closing the autonomy loop on PM-shaped work, then redeploying surplus to SENSE and LEARN (still the #1 gap).

**The one-line verdict:** the engine and the spine are real; the _ends_ of the loop (real ingestion, real outcome learning) and the _packaging_ (the wedge, onboarding, interop) are the unfinished, highest-leverage work. Per the market, the last mile is the moat; closing it is the work, not catch-up.

---

## 6. What I would build next, as the founder, from the current state

Sequenced by leverage, mapped to existing dashboard IDs and v8 phases. This is a priority call, not a new backlog. It assumes the v8 Phase 1 calm-front regroup is in flight.

**Tier 1 - close the loop on real data (this is the moat; nothing matters more).**

- **Land a second live ingest source** (SEN-01): register one connector OAuth client, or lean on the webhook plus a manual import, so SENSE has >=2 real sources. Unblocks "the loop closes on a partner's real data."
- **Build real outcome reviews** (LRN-02): predicted-vs-actual, Historian verdicts, feeding memory rescore. This is v8 Phase 4 and the literal moat object becoming visible. Pair with the existing N3 "referenced N prior decisions" view so the compounding is _seen_.

**Tier 2 - package the wedge (this is what gets a PM to stay).**

- **Ship the Critic-teardown first-run** (§2): a guided "point Supaprod at a feature you believe in" flow that produces an evidence-backed teardown in the first session. Compose from DEC-02 + F-DEC-CARD; add the onboarding wrapper (W6) and make the teardown the shareable artifact on F-SHARE.
- **Turn on the PLG funnel** (PLG): public onboarding to first-win to upgrade. Flip monetization live (M-C-PRICE secrets, M-C-EXPIRY) only once first-win is reliable.

**Tier 3 - defend the moat against the workspace incumbents (pull this forward from M-D).**

- **Ship a thin read-only MCP surface** (slice of Q1 / F-MCP-V1): expose read signals/opps/PRDs and append-decision over MCP. Being the neutral brain across tools is the defense against Linear/Notion/Productboard bundling the loop. A read-only slice is cheap and buys the position early.

**Tier 4 - complete the hybrid spine (only the justified new build).**

- **Sandbox + live preview** (v8 Phase 3): the one real new build engineering, unblocks in-platform tests and preview.
- **Delegate-out contract** (BLD-04): rent the heavy 20% to external coding agents under governance. Deliberately _after_ Tiers 1 to 3, because the 80% path already ships code; this is breadth, not loop-closure.

**What I would explicitly NOT build next:** more in-house Build horsepower beyond the sandbox; the full 19-agent mesh; team/RBAC features (G6 beyond the MCP slice); outcome-based pricing machinery (ship simple seat/usage first, treat outcome pricing as a later experiment, not a launch pillar, since the "outcome unit" is unsolved per v7 §14).

## 7. Open forks still owed (founder calls)

- **Critic as a routable agent vs. inline** (v7/v8 open): the wedge raises the Critic's importance; deciding this affects whether the teardown is a first-class loop step (DEC-02-LOOP).
- **How far to pull MCP forward:** read-only slice now (v9 recommends) vs. wait for M-D.
- **Outcome-pricing unit:** still TBD (v7 §14); v9 recommends deferring it out of the launch story entirely.
- **Naming reconciliation:** product is **Supaprod** (renamed 2026-07-17 from Cadence — see [`../pitch/naming-decision-supaprod.md`](../pitch/naming-decision-supaprod.md)). Earlier history: the 2026-06-10 rebrand was reverted 2026-06-16, and the full repo was swept back to Cadence on 2026-06-17. The 2026-07-17 rename swept the repo to Supaprod in turn (only the unrelated engineering terms remain); no naming pass is outstanding.

## 8. Relationship to canon and the cascade

- **Positioning + market:** [`v7`](./v7-agentic-product-os.md) wins.
- **Structure + surfaces + build-order:** [`v8`](./v8-calm-front-deep-engine.md) wins.
- **Launch wedge + competitor posture + build-next priority:** v9 (this doc).
- **Engine / mesh / contract:** [`v4`](archive/v4-feature-map.md).
- **Live status (audit baseline):** [`../planning/feature-dashboard.md`](../planning/feature-dashboard.md).

Cascade applied this session: strategy [`README.md`](./README.md) index, the session-decisions log, and the [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) read-order pointer. The README/v7 naming pass and any backlog re-priority from §6 are noted as follow-ups, not silently applied.
