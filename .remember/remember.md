# S4 handoff, 2026-08-27 ~04:00 UTC

**FIRST DECISION OF THE MORNING: nothing fixed last night is live.** Production deploys from `main`
and all four lanes sit 9 to 16 commits ahead. Every fix is inert until a merge, and that merge is the
founder's call. S0 declined to take it unilaterally.

## The acceptance, and why it is 0

The loop worked. `a30238f5` walked `sense` to `ship` agent-driven after S0's Discover fix: 13
members, a real pull request, five stations in under three hours, on a track that filed nothing
across twelve drives that morning. **Do not press it** — it is S0's proving ground.

It is parked at `ship` on `given-up`, a terminal hold, and both of Ship's refusals are correct.

**Three things stand between here and R-18, all definitional rather than broken:**

1. **The published query will report a FALSE PASS.** It excludes decided approvals and cannot see a
   press. `a30238f5` has 0 decided approvals and **7 presses**. One extra `NOT IN` against
   `track_drives.driven_via='press'` fixes it (`S4-071`). 19 of 106 tracks carry a press.
2. **No agent can clear a design gate and there is no `prd.approve`** (`S4-076`, corroborated by S0).
   The acceptance also forbids `waived`, so three things must hold that cannot. S0 built `spec-gate.ts`
   for this (F-116).
3. **117 of 119 specs carried no success metric**, so Learn had nothing to grade (S0, F-117).

## What I built, all in `e2e/`

`bash e2e/check-motion.sh [--signed-in] [--phone] [--expired-session] [paths…]`, also
`bun run check:motion`. Boots against a dead database, fabricates the session the guard reads (no
credentials), warms routes **in a browser** and reports: motion that survives a dead backend,
counted progress that ADVANCES (this one fails the build), failure sentences per surface, clipped
unreachable content, controls a screen reader cannot name, prose past Meridian's 68ch measure.

`e2e/helpers/surface-census.mjs` answers what all 95 URLs do: **51 render, 43 redirect, 0 dead.**
14 of those redirects land on `/engine-room`.

## Open, by owner

- **S2** · the lit rail row on `/today` needs a three-way call with S1 and S0 (they fixed the label).
- **S3** · prose at **122ch on `/`** and **165ch on `/pricing`** against a 68ch token (`S4-085`).
- **S1/S3** · `/brain` and `/learn` each announce one dead read **7 times**; both have fixes unmerged.
- **Founder** · outward copy on the hero was checked against canon §5N and is CLEAN, not a defect.

## What I got wrong, so it is not inherited

`/runs` is a dead end (my curl warming), four surfaces show cache keys (my 401 shim), the settings
control is ungated (diagnosis inverted, gating would be the danger), the em dash leak is closed (a
column total proves nothing), `/meridian` is the worst surface (it is the component gallery), 15
forecasts are overdue (13 are demo fixtures). **Five of six were my instrument or my population.**
